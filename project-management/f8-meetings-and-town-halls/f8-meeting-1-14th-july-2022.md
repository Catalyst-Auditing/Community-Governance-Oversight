## Agenda

## 1. CGO Treasury

* **0:59 Andre** - This is the last F7 meeting; we need to pay for the minutes for this meeting, then decide what to do with any remaining funds. The payment made to group members on Tuesday was for the Fund 8 CGO.
* **02:20 Stephen** - We shouldnâ€™t discuss the F8 proposal until the first F8 meeting. This meeting needs to decide - when we write our final F7 report, where should the money for deliverables go? Divide equally, or not? To be decided at end of this meeting, when we have an idea of what work is being done on different deliverables.
