Allison went into a little more depth about CGO history and where we came from and what we're trying to do. We did ask people to comment on parameters this time around either in the chat or in discord.&#x20;

**08:01 - Thorsten** - Do we have a publicly accessible register of all the parameters which we have identified?

**Stephen -** No we do not. Do you think we should do that ?

**Thorsten -** I think it would be helpful. Yes.

**08:41 - Phil K** - IOG have forewarning now that CGO are noting parameter changes at Town Hall slides. So I think that is a good place to start.&#x20;

**Stephen -** We are doing oversight of parameters. And I suppose that's what the question is, is how we are going to approach that? Allison's obviously you're doing you're doing a kind of an overview for every town hall slide presentation.

**Allison -** That is meant to be only the most recent changes that we have informally observed. I agree that, ideally, documenting all parameters and logging when they change, how that decision is made and how it's communicated would be fantastic. But that is a lot of work.&#x20;

## 3. CGO Project Board Review

**09:59 - Stephen W**
