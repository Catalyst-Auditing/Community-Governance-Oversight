All meeting attendance is already paid

\


should we develop a process for paying deliverables? Splitting equally is easier (Allison)

Tevo - we estimate delivery time of how much tasks cost. Everyone who contributes shares how much time they spent, if no information, the estimated cost will be shared equally between participants of specific task.

Vanessa - Should we split distributions between high level epics/projects/themes or we take reward each deliverable differently.

Phil - community distribution model - equal split and can choose to redistribute your share to others

Kenric - baseline = split evenly, then specific tasks - bonus pool? for those who put in extra effort. Decide thisusing Phil’s method.

Phil - easier to just pay everyone equal and then reallocate

Phil - this doesn’t change what’s already allocated

Andre - pay treasury in full this time, and then divide the rest between all of us Rename it “deliverables”

Leave it with Treasury until such time as deliverables are done? AGREED

Need to set aside money for closing report too

F7 proposal final payment - deliverables payments is what is outstanding
