## Agenda

## 1 - Action points from previous meetings:

{% hint style="info" %}
**New documentation process** - has been discussed in Discord, so checking - are there any objections? - no objections
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Adding something to F9 IOG survey (Phil)** - is this in progress? Any updates? - not happening
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**We should have received final F7 payment last week** - did we? - and we agreed to pilot Phil’s community redistribution model for the “deliverables” portion of that - updates? how do we initiate that? - have side meeting to discuss further - Phil K
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vanessa was supposed to share the Parameters reporting google form in Discord** - didn’t, sorry - it’s here https://forms.gle/EtxhcmnJUv7nP1KB9 and is on agenda
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We said 2 meetings ago that **we would follow up with Harris after F7 parameter changes meeting**. Haven’t yet. It’s on agenda.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Payment for writing F10 proposal**
{% endhint %}

In last meeting there was some confusion over payment for writing future CGO proposal. List of outstanding items said “payment for writing F9 proposal” and ofc there isn’t an F9 proposal, but I believe it should have said “payment for writing F10 proposal”. Correct?Are we planning to submit something for F10 if there’s a suitable challenge? If yes, we can keep it on agenda and in budget plan.

Yes - allocate to F10 CGO proposal and discuss async



## 2 - CGO Treasury

Andre & Miroslav - after what has been paid, what is left?.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Fund 7 Community Governance Oversight USD status](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v8EySgaWqoYlOVxHAjKKufj24x8CPn-no33EUPZP8sw/edit?usp=sharing)
{% endhint %}

Last meeting we said we’ll receive $ 6860 on Mon; will pay all TH slides and project management, and pay Treasury management in full. Yes received and paid

Items left to pay for CGO 8 should therefore be: (Reports, Retros, Surveys) = “Deliverables”; Prep of F10 proposal (agreed); closing report.

F7 proposal final payment - deliverables, close out report and project management are still to be paid? (Treasury management?)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action -** No objections to paying Treasury $1000 - PM $2000 from F7 and remainder to be distributed using Phil K's system&#x20;
{% endhint %}



## 3 - Town Hall Slides

Allison - Updates on Town Hall Slides

[https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/110](https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/110)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note** - Suggestion last meeting was to use CGO TH slides and newsletter to help inform people about CCv4 election as soon as we know details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - Next slides - advertise dRep white paper - Wednesday 5th October 2022
{% endhint %}



## 4 - F8 CGO Scope & Deliverables

## 4.1 - Challenge Setting <a href="#docs-internal-guid-848d2b87-7fff-4c86-8d26-c11965a2c43d" id="docs-internal-guid-848d2b87-7fff-4c86-8d26-c11965a2c43d"></a>

What is the scope of F8 Challenge Setting oversight ?

Issue : [https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/88](https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/88)
{% endhint %}

* George Lovegrove's meeting with Kriss Baird postponed until Friday, 23rd September 2022. Updates to follow.
* We planned to decide details of this deliverable after George’s meeting with Kriss. &#x20;
* What has the community understanding and debate been?
* Intent (what people thought the intent was) vs what was achieved- this is for an F10 CGO proposal really tho, cos we won’t know until after end of this proposal’s work
* Recent after town hall

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt0Efbtngnc" %}

* [1:07](https://youtu.be/lt0Efbtngnc?t=4017) - Talks about categorisation
* [1:23](https://youtu.be/lt0Efbtngnc?t=4987) - Kriss talks about issues with challenge settings & initial thoughts for next steps

How are decisions being made in respect of Challenge Setting (eg whether to reform etc) in the abscence of a vote ? - Stephen W

Suggest aiming for a summary of the issues we have discussed to date on how any changes are to be made to Challenge Setting. Via a vote, IOG approval etc. And try to identify what the intent of any changes should be - so this can be tested. This summary would then form part of the F8 CGO final report or be a retrospective where further input is invited from the community - Stephen W



## 4.2 Catalyst Circle Oversight <a href="#docs-internal-guid-fa241523-7fff-d215-efd3-8170bb6b8663" id="docs-internal-guid-fa241523-7fff-d215-efd3-8170bb6b8663"></a>

What is the scope of F8 Catalyst Circle Oversight ?

{% endhint %}

### Circle payment via parameter change

Issue raised in a recent CCv3 meeting- if Circle are paid via a parameter change, they will need to log what they do. Felix has approached CGO for any input we might have on how this could be done. Is this in scope for CGO’s oversight of Circle? If yes, do we have capacity?

CGO has limited capacity so probably not.

Is it something CGO should do?

We could look at what they propose rather than trying to steer it.

We should liaise with CC Admin as was (Governance Services Guild) - we don’t want to step on their toes

if they need help to have oversight we could advise them with the knowledge we have.&#x20;

Looking at whether they are following their plan or not. We (CGO) should oversee; CC Admin should design and plan. If we have oversight, we cannot be the ones who design the process. - Thorsten

We should be looking at “how do we make decisions". Decision making models. - Phil

Is Circle currently following the spirit of the Voltaire principles. What is Circle trying to achieved ?

Continuing legitimacy issue that Circle has decided to verify its own process

We shouldn’t get involved - Matthias - Working group is OK but they’re not legitimate as Circle - doing oversight for them gives them legitimacy

Should our Circle oversight for F8 include writing up the issues that we think have been problematic regarding legitimacy ?

### Circle election process

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - How will we maintain oversight of the election process and results - what data will we collect?
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - Who will gather oversight  info on how the election was designed and structured? (Vani has some, via Circle oversight)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Circle and parameter changes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - What is the overlap between Circle oversight and “parameter changes”?
{% endhint %}
