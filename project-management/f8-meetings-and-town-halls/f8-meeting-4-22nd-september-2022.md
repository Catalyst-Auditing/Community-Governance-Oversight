## Agenda

## 1 - Action points from previous meetings:

{% hint style="info" %}
**New documentation process** - has been discussed in Discord, so checking - are there any objections? - no objections
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Adding something to F9 IOG survey (Phil)** - is this in progress? Any updates? - not happening
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**We should have received final F7 payment last week** - did we? - and we agreed to pilot Phil’s community redistribution model for the “deliverables” portion of that - updates? how do we initiate that? - have side meeting to discuss further - Phil K
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vanessa was supposed to share the Parameters reporting google form in Discord** - didn’t, sorry - it’s here https://forms.gle/EtxhcmnJUv7nP1KB9 and is on agenda
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We said 2 meetings ago that **we would follow up with Harris after F7 parameter changes meeting**. Haven’t yet. It’s on agenda.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Payment for writing F10 proposal**
{% endhint %}

In last meeting there was some confusion over payment for writing future CGO proposal. List of outstanding items said “payment for writing F9 proposal” and ofc there isn’t an F9 proposal, but I believe it should have said “payment for writing F10 proposal”. Correct?Are we planning to submit something for F10 if there’s a suitable challenge? If yes, we can keep it on agenda and in budget plan.

Yes - allocate to F10 CGO proposal and discuss async



## 2 - CGO Treasury

Andre & Miroslav - after what has been paid, what is left?.

{% endhint %}

Last meeting we said we’ll receive $ 6860 on Mon; will pay all TH slides and project management, and pay Treasury management in full. Yes received and paid

Items left to pay for CGO 8 should therefore be: (Reports, Retros, Surveys) = “Deliverables”; Prep of F10 proposal (agreed); closing report.

F7 proposal final payment - deliverables, close out report and project management are still to be paid? (Treasury management?)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action -** No objections to paying Treasury $1000 - PM $2000 from F7 and remainder to be distributed using Phil K's system&#x20;
{% endhint %}



## 3 - Town Hall Slides

Allison - Updates on Town Hall Slides

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note** - Suggestion last meeting was to use CGO TH slides and newsletter to help inform people about CCv4 election as soon as we know details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - Next slides - advertise dRep white paper - Wednesday 5th October 2022
