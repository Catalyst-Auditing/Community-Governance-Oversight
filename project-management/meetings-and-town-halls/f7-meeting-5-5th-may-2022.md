[F8 Ideascale proposal ](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398225)

## Agenda

## 1. CGO Treasury

Andre & Mirolav - updates on Treasury setup, member payments, costs & expenses.&#x20;

0:55 Andre – We've paid everything except the surveys, retrospectives and reports. We need to do the math on that tomorrow, to be ready for when funds go in on 9th May.&#x20;

01:35 Stephen – We've already paid for Town Hall slides and everything else

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action -** Deliverables budgeting - Andre & Stephen
{% endhint %}

## 2. Town Hall Slides&#x20;

Issue

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/72" %}

* 02:02 Allison – The slides were delivered
* 02:26 Stephen – Links to our F8 proposal have been removed from the Town Hall slides. Not everyone presenting at Town Hall did this during the voting period.&#x20;
* 03:03 Phil – Probably because some people were showing videos that were already pre-recorded.&#x20;
* 03:35 Phil – Might be interesting to know what external people are thinking about this group - perhaps a survey?
* 04:53 Matthias – Voting result on our F8 proposal might tell us that.

## 3. Fund 8 - CGO Proposal&#x20;

Issue&#x20;

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/65" %}

04:55 Stephen - The Fund 8 CGO Proposal is in the voting stage - no updates

## 4. CGO Project Board Review

Stephen - Brief Review of the Project Board to check overall progress

{% embed url="https://github.com/orgs/Catalyst-Auditing/projects/3/views/1" %}

* 05:36 Stephen – Outline of our outstanding tasks.

## 5. F7 CGO Scope and Deliverables

### 5.1 Challenge setting process

Issue

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/48" %}

* 6:49 Allison – George Lovegrove would be interested in talking to the group and seeing if there is any synergy.&#x20;
* 07:20 Stephen – Need to get some context about what is happening in the challenge configuration, put that in our final report for this proposal, and leave it at that until Fund 8.&#x20;
* 7:46 Phil - Analysis of how George approached the Fund 8 vote would be interesting: whether voters understood what he was doing and, for example, whether equal wallets voted for all his challenge settings.&#x20;
* 9:44 Stephen - it raises the question of whether it's possible to change a parameter via a challenge setting
* 12:43 Phil – On meeting with Ro, due to the time difference, a separate meeting would be better

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action - Stephen to contact George and arrange a meeting**

**Action - Phil to arrange a separate meeting with Ro, c. 9:30 am UTC one morning.**
{% endhint %}

### 5.2 Catalyst Circle problem sensing

Issue&#x20;

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/47" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action -** Next TH refer to CCv3 term and election process. How does the 4 month cadence impact CC term.
{% endhint %}

* 15:04 Stephen – We are having regular meetings with Circle and looking at the problem process.&#x20;
* 15:34 Allison – It could help circle reps be more effective.
* 16:10 Tevo – We are halfway there and the next sessions will be about the prioritised problem stage the Circle is working on.&#x20;
* 16:44 Stephen – We have looked at the problem-sensing rubric inherited from Governance Alive and refined it. Our next focus will be how problems get onto the board; a key metric we have identified is whether there's community evidence behind it. After that our  focus will be whether there is any methodology in place for measuring problems and progressing them across the board. Probably will not finish in fund 7, but can report on how far we get.
* 18:34 Stephen – Suggest combining the report to IOG to close out the proposal, with our final report on our work.&#x20;
* 19:04 Stephen – A shared document has been created that can be completed offline or at the next meeting.&#x20;
* 20:20 Allison – As part of our work to increase transparency of governance across Catalyst, maybe we should comment in our next town hall slides that there is not a Circle election happening now.&#x20;
* 20:52 Vanessa – Some confusion on this during CCv2, but was definitely clarified at the start of CCv3 that CCv3 would last for 6 months.
* 21:29 Allison – Useful to give a reminder to the community, especially as there was some confusion about it at the time of the CCv3 election; even some candidates didn't understand what the term was.&#x20;
* 24:42 Vanessa – Even if most of the community is aware of the 6 month term, they might not be aware how that was agreed.&#x20;
* 27:15 Phil – Cadence of the funding rounds is now effectively 4 months - should CC cadence stay in step with that?
* 27:33 Allison -  That change of fund cadence is a parameter change.
* 28:39 Matthias - the change to fund 9 being in ADA is also a parameter change.
* 28:56 Stephen - let's hold those 2 things for the agenda item on parameter changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action:** Allison to mention issue of Circle elections on next Town Hall slides

**Action:** all to contribute to shared doc of final report, which will also serve as project close-out report
{% endhint %}

### 5.3 D-reps

Issue

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/49" %}

29:10 Stephen – Kenric is not here, so quick update: A first governance literature review meeting took place with Steph from Wolfram and others, where the Zotero tool was reviewed; we're going to start holding these meetings regularly, so they're likely to overlap with the fund 8 proposal.

### 5.4 **Governance parameters**

Issue

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/50" %}

* [**https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_ljPS0hg=/?moveToWidget=3458764519526918582\&cot=10**](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_ljPS0hg=/?moveToWidget=3458764519526918582\&cot=10) - Tevo
* VCA QA Petition process - way of requesting review if assessment unfairly reviewed&#x20;
* Results go to IOG - then what? An arbitrary decision? Community agency&#x20;
* Meeting with Harris re opening data - when community meets targets take over decisions 4 month Cadence - Funds in ADA.&#x20;
* These changes count as parameter changes?&#x20;
* Communication - discussion. Consultation?&#x20;
* Cost to submit proposals - different sources captured - Tevo&#x20;
* Who decides - feedback to community - Phil&#x20;
* Access to the research team ie the “Technical Council” and whoever else at IOG is involved in researching parameter changes? - PhilDocument parameter changes - to present back to IOG&#x20;
* Alignment on what a parameter is between IOG, Oversight & community
* Define a parameter&#x20;
* Catalogue existing parameters / new parameters Document where new parameters came from and where/how they were announced?



* 30:30 Tevo – Parameters are of two types: about the process, and about specific terms like number, date or some limit.  To make it a parameter, you need a brief description of it, and you need to know how it can be changed. Also need to unstand which ones need to be changed behind closed doors, and which could be done in the community; Kevin Hammond's recent talk at Town Hall mentioned this.
* 32:33 Stephen – A transcript of Kevin Hammond's ATH meeting has been made, and turned into a [FAQ about the Treasury](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/governance-processes/governance-parameters/cardano-treasury-with-kevin-hammond).&#x20;
* Returning to earlier comments in this meeting - parameter changes include:.&#x20;
  * cadence format\
    idea.&#x20;
* 34:09 Phil – Now there is a way to ask for a review. Whether the reviews were unfairly removed or the VCAs are not working well.&#x20;
* 34:32 Allison – There are two more associated with VCAs. 1) is who is eligible to be a VCA. That was a parameter to change this background. 2) the introduction of a reputation model for VCAs.&#x20;
* 34:51 Phil – A permissionless system was created for this petition process, we operate it, but we've been hamstrung. We don't have any community agency, we get things started but we don't have control over the effects and the existing processes. We have a team doing research, but so is the community.&#x20;
* 36:39 Stephen – It's not clear how the parameter changes are made. The order that was perceived is: community design a petition process > getting results > which are taken to IOG > next step is unknown.&#x20;
* 37:10 Phil – We as a community need IOG to take some steps forward. It gets to a point where the community has already developed these posts well but IOG needs to provide feedback.&#x20;
* 38:27 Stephen – There is no clarity about what to do, how to assume that people are in the process.&#x20;
* 38:54 Phil – Catalyst is no longer in the early stages, a lot of people come from different backgrounds to discuss various subjects. Therefore, the next step is now to work out how the community can start helping IRG remove what it can from being the stewards and that's it.&#x20;
* 41:22 Phil – It is important that the parameters are discussed and defined so that the IOG starts to make changes in a way that is more aligned with th community.
* 41:41 Stephen – We should be working on the equivalent of a parameter change rubric in the same way that we have a rubric for a prioritized problem. There is no consistency.
* 42:11 Vanessa – This kind of parameter change is approached in a very piecemeal way. For example, in the telegram group a parameter change was posted as an answer to a question and not as an official announcement.&#x20;
* 43:08 Vanessa – There is a question about what a parameter change would be, for that we analyze how the change alters the way things work. There are no changes being made to like big parameters that everyone recognizes as a parameter. But there are the arbitrary, little things that really have a massive effect.&#x20;
* 44:15 Stephen – It would be important to talk about the parameters in the city hall.&#x20;
* 44:54 Phil – The community needs to be better informed. It is necessary to define the best communication channel. There is no debate option at the moment for the community, because it's an IOG parameter being put into practice, we can only discuss the edges of that parameter, not the core of it at this point.&#x20;
* 46:31 Stephen – If we don't know something we need to ask why.&#x20;
* 49:43 Stephen – Some questions about how the parameter change should have been discussed: how was it decided, when, with whom and so on. All these issues should be within the reach of the community.&#x20;
* 50:16 Allison – At the origin of this group, the ideal was to ensure that the parameters were debated, discussed, researched and communicated as widely as possible.&#x20;
* 51:20 Phil – We need a regular meeting with those people who are researching for feedback, what they're researching, and then getting that out to the community.
* 53:20 Allison – Since Harris is not part of the group it would be important to know if Phill is seeing him.&#x20;
* 54:09 Stephen – Danny was invited to the meeting, but there was a time conflict with another appointment of his.&#x20;
* 56:37 Phil – The parameter needs some time to be created, discussed, changed and moved. Our purpose as a group is to start looking at this and informing the community as transparently as possible.&#x20;
* 57:23 Tevo – An example of this would be taking this four-month cadence, for example, and then turning it into a parameter. It would be interesting to document this process.&#x20;
* 58:52 Stephen – The big question is, like, what is an alignment of parameters through the IOG oversight committee? What is the parameter? And do we have a perception of what a parameter is?&#x20;
* 59:24 Phil – We need to set a parameter both internally and externally, catalog the ones that already exist and how we see them.&#x20;
* 01:00:31 Vanessa – We can list about the parameters where they came from, where they were first mentioned, or released and so on.&#x20;
* 01:01:12 Allison – It would be important to bring someone to IOG for this conversation.&#x20;
* 01:01:46 Stephen – A meeting is needed before the next CGO meeting.&#x20;
* 01:02:16 Phil – At this meeting we would discuss what we define as parameters and a categorized list of those we identify, and we would like to present that at the next Town Hall.

**Action -** Hold a CGO meeting to discuss next week.

## &#x20;**6 FUND 7 CGO Proposal Reporting**

Due 24th May 2022 - Stephen to complete&#x20;

Issue

* 01:03:01 Stephen – We need a meeting next week. We would all have the opportunity to set the agenda for this and decide which actions would come out of this field.&#x20;
* 01:02:28 Matthias – Ideally, we would return to maximum human collaboration, but Ada's instability as a currency is very exclusionary. It would be important to bring real-world people into the catalyst, especially as we focus so much on technology. We need an audit at thenext town hall meeting, an update of the circle.&#x20;
* 01:05:40 Stephen – The example we have at the moment is the petition process, the form of cadence of funds, in a way that we want to call all these things and anything else we can think of to document them; not to go into too much detail. But just to identify where tha decision-making process was.&#x20;
* 01:07:01 Stephen – Will try to contact Danny (to join the meeting) and also Harris.
* 01:08:47 Allisson – Harris is the most relevant to this conversation.&#x20;
* 01:14:08 Tevo – We did three sections are regarding proposal advisor road. So that would be the Community Advisor. Andthe completed it so that there is no more questions to add to this template. I took a slight break. But the only way to finalize it is to make now one overview video, which is less than 10 minutes to encapsulate all of that information.&#x20;
* 01:16:52 Stephen – We are producing a lot of activity and will deliver as much as possible in the final report. If we are funded again, continue to work on it.

* 01:11:01 Stephen – We are discussing parameter changes, twittering all our meetings. We've done a lot of production in the last couple of weeks and I can sum it all up. Any AOP is also geared towards this type of last update as to what else is going on as well. So the Constitutional Working Group retires, for example.
* 01:12:00 Vanessa – Other Catalyst communities are also having governance initiatives. For example, the LatAm community is creating a Catalyst manifesto, doing ongoing and interesting work on it - they will be sharing that more widely when it's ready.
