## Agenda

## 1. CGO Treasury

**Andre & Miroslav** - updates on Treasury setup, member payments, costs & expenses.

**Deliverables budgeting - Andre & Stephen**

* 0:59 Andre - This is the last meeting, so we need to pay for the minutes for this meeting, then decide what to do with any remaining funds.&#x20;
* 01:48 Andre - Payment made to group members on Tuesday was for the Fund 8 CGO.&#x20;
* 02:20 Stephen - We shouldn’t discuss the F8 proposal until the first F8 meeting, which will be at the end of June. This meeting needs to decide - when we write our final F7 report, where should the money for deliverables go? Divide equally, or not? To be decided at end of this meeting, when we have an idea of what work is being done on different deliverables.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action:** Pay for meeting minutes - decide on allocation of remaining funds.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Town Hall Slides&#x20;

Allison - Updates on Town Hall Slides

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/72" %}

Clarity on Challenge Budgets - AOB

* 03:22 Allison - Slides cover history of who the group is and where it came from, and updates on what's going on in governance. Yesterday, focused on updates on parameter changes. It is planned to continue with this format. Yesterday, specific parameter issue of confusion on whether challenge budgets are denominated in USD or ADA - want to give clarity on this next time.&#x20;
* 05:46: Vanessa - will you highlight a different aspect of CGO’s work each time, or focus on parameter changes?&#x20;
* 6:03 Allison - Parameter changes; as it’s overarching enough to cover most of what we do. If there is a different area of ​​CGO that needs highlighting, as a one-off or regularly, I can.&#x20;
* 06:30 Vanessa - The next update could include dReps, as the workshops will have taken place and there may be community discussion about them&#x20;
* 06:56 Allison - Covering dReps in the 2nd slide, on general governance updates.
* 07:24 Allison - Don’t want to have a slide on parameter changes if there haven’t been any - but note there’s a different audience each TH. Also, want to ask the community if they have noted any parameter changes&#x20;
* 7:45 Phil - We need some sort of input mechanism, maybe a form, or make a place for it in CGO Discord server, so people can highlight and question what they see as parameter changes and we are not the only ones tracking them.&#x20;
* 08:37 Phil - Note that “total fund budget” is total for proposals; there is the additional budget for the quality control process and voters.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action:** Any updates, feedback or suggestions. History of CGO group - update on parameter changes Highlight different areas of CGO work? - Vanessa Matters that are new parameter changes - Phil Different audience each week - Allison Direct to discord to discuss parameters - Invite people in TH to say in chat if they have noticed any parameter changes that week (from meeting chat).
{% endhint %}

## 3. Fund 8 - CGO Proposal&#x20;

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/65" %}

* 09:24 Stephen - F8 CGO proposal was successfully voted on and funded. We have paid first payment for meeting commitment. People have committed to the F8 project - new members Thorsten and George. George will not be attending meetings but will be working on challenge settings; and Thorsten will be attending meetings.

## 4. CGO Project Board Review

**Board:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/orgs/Catalyst-Auditing/projects/3/views/1" %}

* 10:38 Stephen - The project board is a little out of date. We need to do F8 onboarding, later this month. Currently we’re working on the 4 different parts of the final report: oversight of Circle problem sensing, dReps, governance parameters, and challenge-setting.

## 5. F7 CGO Scope and Deliverables

### 5.1 Challenge setting process

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/48" %}

**Actions from previous meetings:**

Met with George Lovegrove and agreed that he will do a one page summary and conclusion for the Challenge Setting part of the F7 CGO final report.

Phil to reach out to George for a counterpoint**.**

* 11:39 Stephen - We've had several discussions about how to do oversight of challenge setting. Phil did talk to Ro, but for final report it’s gone towards George Lovegrove, who has agreed to do a one page summary and conclusion looking back over the past three months on challenge-setting issues. Is that the best focus given the time that we have?&#x20;
* 12:52 Phil - George has a specific line on what he sees as challenge setting, and has been working towards a specific goal. I agree with most of it, but not all, so I’ll contact George to provide a counterpoint.&#x20;
* 13:35 Stephen - Agreed.

### 5.2 Catalyst Circle problem sensing

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/47" %}

**Actions from previous meeting:**

Joint working party meetings with Catalyst Circle V3 on the Problems process (Allison, Stephen, Tevo).

Working group meeting 5 - Tuesday 31st May 2022 Any updates, feedback or suggestions. Research had value - how to problem sense - testing out submitting work tasks using problem process - tevo Focus on moving across board - involving more Circle reps (Allison). How much detail in problem / issue (Vanessa). Ongoing discussion of incentives and compensation for designing (not discussed in circle workshop) Who has mandate to design processes - (Allison). Subcircles were funded - so given a mandate? - funded proposal led representation? Phil Problem reducing partiaption - reducing electing Circle members - (Kenric). Does funding equate to legitimacy? (Stephen). How Circle problems are closed? (Tevo).

* 14:42 Stephen - Tevo, Allison, Stephen and Nadia met on Tues to wrap up&#x20;
* 15:04 Tevo - The process will continue, as it does seem to be bringing value. Thinking about the process of problem-sensing has opened opportuniies to use this in different networks, e.g. creating a task using the problem-sensing methodology.&#x20;
* 16:04 Allison - 2 key takeaways: 1) We have spent a lot of time on the process of getting problems on the board and less attention on how they move across the board, and especially how they are closed - this could be an area for future focus. 2) It would be good to get more participation from Circle.&#x20;
* 16:40 Stephen - On Miro we did a retrospective of what we’ve covered in the ladt 4 working meetings - need to summarise and include in final report. Key conclusions focused on process of moveing problems across the board, and broader involvement from more Circle reps.&#x20;
* 17:47 Vanessa - On moving problems across the board - last Circle meeting raised additional issue of how much detail should be included in a card when documenting a problem’s progress.&#x20;
* 18:13 Stephen - There is possibly an issue that as an oversight group, is it appropriate for us to have helped design the process? Feeling is that Oversight can be a support, and Circle have found it helpful, so it’s OK.&#x20;
* 18:52 Allison - There's an ongoing question of who is mandated to design the processes and workflows that Circle follows? and who should be incentivised and compensated for that?- Note this hasn’t been discussed in our meetings.&#x20;
* 20:00 Vanessa - Was there any sense that Allison, Tevo and Stephen were partly doing this work as Circle mentors?&#x20;
* 20:10 Allison - I never thought about it as Circle mentorship&#x20;
* 20:32 Stephen - The beginning of our oversight of Circle coincided with the election of new Circle members, so we took a support role early on, with the design of the problem-sensing process. But that’s turned into potentially a scoping issue for us, and a mandate issue, since we are meant to be overseeing Circle’s problem-sensing, not directly working on it.&#x20;
* 21:17 Phil - Given that sub-circles were funded and Circle was not, I feel that could give them a mandate to put forward a rep to create a new Circle. It would need to be more broadly discussed, but I see an advantage to using sub-circles to put forward or elect representatives to be the human sensory array.&#x20;
* 22:33 Kenric - Problem is, that reduces the level of participation in electing Circle members. The process has already been criticised for not being inclusive enough of the community. 23:15 Phil - But the sub-circles were voted on by many wallets, so they are even more mandated than the small numbers who take poart in Circle elections.&#x20;
* 23:35 Stephen - That raises another fundamental issue - if you’re funded, does that equate to legitimacy? (Add link here to the discussion on this in Swarm discord?)&#x20;
* 23:45 Kenric - This issue was easy to foresee - when I was a Circle rep (CCv2) there were already concerns about the Circle role and how it was elected. However, the community doesn't function without leadership. At present we are dependent on IOG’s leadership, but there has to be a transition to community leadership. Maybe there should be a F9 proposal on designing the treasury, or compensation, for the Circle via putting in a CIP.&#x20;
* 25:18 Stephen - These conversations are valid, but outside the scope of Oversight. On Circle problem-sensing - CGO 7 strayed a little into solutions rather than oversight, but Circle have seem to have said they want to continue to partner with CGO 8 on problem-sensing. So that’s our remit - we don;t have a mandate to offer solutions.&#x20;
* 26:15 Phil - The original concept of Circle was never to have just one Circle but several. And there are funded groups that represent smaller parts of the community; including ourselves. There would be nothing to stop those groups forming a Circle and operating as a human sensory array, modelled on “the” Circle.&#x20;
* 26:49 Stephen - It's a really important question. Form the point of view of CGO, we will continue to offer oversight of, specifically, Circle’s problem-sensing. How that plays out in the next 3 months remains to be seen, but Oversight is all we’ll be doing.&#x20;
* 27:53 Tevo - the expectation from our retrospective is that Oversight includes overseeing how tasks are closed; currently there is no process. And oversee how a process is created, to allow maximum participation.&#x20;
* 28:39 Stephen - In terms of the final report, we need to summarise what is in the Miro and the documentation down to 1 page; We will reach some conclusions that will reflect these issues, such as the question of balance between Oversight, and the mandate to revise Circle’s process.

### 5.3 D-reps

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/49" %}

**Updates** - DAO Governance Literature Review - Meeting 10th May 2022**.**

Group went well - 3 meetings - 5 people For F8 measuring socio eco - white paper Using zotero as a team.

* 30:09 Kenric - There were group meetings to work on the literature on D reps. There was one article in particular, on measuring power in liquid democracies, which we did a very thorough sort of review. There is a document made by me and Stephen. This gives us a good start for the transition to aid funds. We will work as a team to produce a white paper on what we are tentatively calling “measuring socioeconomic health”. You need to make sure you are a general liquid democracy or delegated representatives to be specific to the catalyst.&#x20;
* 31:44 Stephen - I was doing more detailed documentation of the current meetings. There were three main meetings. These materials will be reference for Kenric's summary. Your summary item must fit in the final report.&#x20;
* 32:48 Kenric - We're making good use of the Sotero bibliography tool with a team. I'm learning your capabilities and weaknesses. However, apparently the tool does not interact so well with google docs. This issue must be resolved.&#x20;
* 33:30 Stephen - The draft report of what we've done so far needs to be completed. And there probably needs to be some sort of completion camera.
* 34:06 Stephen - What we did was put together a review of the literature, which was important for us to start others for scholarly work on liquid democracy. We're not going to come to any conclusions since we're just at the beginning.&#x20;
* 35:35 Tevo - It's important to coordinate that everyone is seeing the same page to avoid unnecessary time spent in meetings.&#x20;
* 36:45 Stephen - It's important to report the timing and sessions of these meetings so people can jump to the part that interests them. We can feed on a brief summary of what has happened with the representatives so far, or in the final report, a few very brief sentences about it to complement the literature review.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action:** Document for Final Report One suggestion - coordinating - seeing same page.
{% endhint %}

### 5.4 **Governance parameters**

**Scope:** Modifying the governance parameters in Catalyst via Catalyst Circle and a Technical Council.&#x20;

**Deliverables:** This scope area is on hold. Some documentation work may be done.

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/50" %}

Agreement on participating going forward - **** Allison. IOG participation going forward ? - Stephen. Effective invited Harris separate meeting - Vanessa. Agree - & standing open invite - Phil. Would be beneficial IOG participate regularly - Allison. More clarity needed from IOG needed - Kenric. After voting - exchange rate set - will determine USD equ - Kenric. Internal consistency and communications from IOG - Allison. Arguments for / against - would not demand - Matthias. Reach out to Seb - CIP editor - changing governance parameters - Kenric.

**Actions from previous meeting:**

Suggestion of a open channel.

Deadline for final drafts - 20th June 2022 Close out for CGO F7 - 30th June 2022.

* 38:48 Allison - It was thought that we would leave the meeting with an agreement that Harris would start attending regular CGO meetings.&#x20;
* 39:14 Phil-Maybe not necessarily him, but another representative on his behalf.
* 39:31 Stephen - It's an interesting question whether we should invite IOG members to meetings.
* 40:09 Vanessa - It's interesting that anyone interested is welcome, but we can't predict what's going to happen at the meeting to invite someone in advance.
* 40:36 Phil - It's interesting to have a separate meeting focused on discussing specific parameters, inviting these people.
* 41:02 Allison - I think the opposite, it would be interesting for someone from IOG to participate regularly in our meetings. We don't know where the discussion is going. It would also be interesting to make a more regular commitment.&#x20;
* 41:54 Stephen - Maybe we need to take this question in a more asynchronous way.&#x20;
* 42:07 Kerin - More clarity is needed from the IOG, they set the Ada value for the total budget, the exchange rate, how many dollars will be funded per project and etc.&#x20;
* 43:09 Allison - I don't think all parts of the IOG are clear on the issue of what is defined in Ada and the dollar.&#x20;
* 43:42 Allison - We need a very clear statement on these matters from the IOG.
* 45:15 Matthias - There are many arguments for and against the continued participation of IOG members in these meetings. In my opinion, ongoing participation is not necessary.&#x20;
* 46:49 Stephen - It would be interesting to have more meetings to discuss the subject and also the discussion about what supervision is and its relationship with the parameters of governance.&#x20;
* 48:07 Kenric - Another person that I recommend being included in this is Sebastian from DC sharp.&#x20;
* 50:13 Kenric - Although there are disagreements around participating in governance, it would potentially be useful to change if someone puts a proposal on the CIP process.&#x20;
* 53:08 Kenric - There is a technical committee that is up and running, and they are responsible for these governance parameters.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Action** - Document for Final Report.

## 7. Any **Other Business**

Overview video where I captured the main highlights of the Proposal Assessor role**:**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWWnwLhspbs" %}

CA was changed to Proposer assessor - no formal discussion? Are things being sprung on us? More consultation - Phil (and particularly on this, because all the community resources need to be updated to read PA instead of CA…). Summary of CGO meeting for Catalyst Weekly Newsletter.

Agree a short paragraph summarizing today's meeting - All.

**Issue:**

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/66" %}

Clarity on Challenge Budgets - AOB.

* 54:27 Phil - You can make internal arguments for searchable parameter groups more public and accessible.&#x20;
* 55:15 Phil - Maybe this discussion is not for the oversight role, it could be opened up in the report so that channel opens up.&#x20;
* 55:41 Stephen - I think we can include an item for that in the current report.&#x20;
* 55:57 Phil - We need to write the report before we have the final meeting. We need to write offline all the various aspects and have a deadline for submitting the final report&#x20;
* 56:20 Stephen - We've just discussed governance parameters and each one has a different job to do. They can have one-on-one meetings, we need to put that in a draft doc, there will be a doc on google that we can refine synchronously.&#x20;
* 57:11 Phil - It's good to have a final closing meeting and set a firm date. 59:03 Phil - A suggestion is on June 20th.
* 01:03:56 Phil - We're looking at parameter changes, because they exist and IOG is jumping on them. We need to mention what is happening, how to progress and say it will happen. This theme may appear in our conclusions, in our report.
