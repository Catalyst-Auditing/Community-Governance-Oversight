# Fund 8 Challenge Setting Report

## Issues that were identified&#x20;

Assessment approach for challenges needs improvement - The information for challenge assessment guidance is limited and is of low quality. As one example, assessments penalize proposals that do not have a fully formed challenge team at the point of submission even though the team can be formed at any stage after they are voted in.&#x20;

Duplicated challenge settings - Products & Integrations was copied into a separate proposal called DApps, Products & Integrations. This increased complexity for the voters in how they should vote to get their desired outcome. Duplicated categorisations lead to potential situations where neither challenge gets funded or both do. In this instance both got funded and the categorisations got merged.&#x20;

Overlapping categorisations - Overlapping categorisations add complexity for proposers when submitting proposals as they must decide between multiple categorisations. Voters have higher complexity when similar proposals are submitted in separate categorisations.&#x20;

Observations

Little to no funding access for some focus areas - Community & outreach and Catalyst focussed proposals saw either little or no access to funding for fund 9. Overlapping categorisations - Examples include 14 overlapping product & integration categorisations, 12 overlapping outreach categorisations, 12 overlapping community categorisations and 9 overlapping Catalyst categorisations amongst others 19 broad categorisations and 53 specific categorisations were submitted&#x20;

Funding categories as an alternative Analysis has continued on funding categories as an alternative approach to funding categorisation - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/ Access to funding for different focus areas Fund 8 challenge settings led to selected categorisations for fund 9 that had very high funding access for some areas compared over other focus areas.

Funding categories could achieve similar or better outcomes in most cases with a simpler approach. A similar outcome would be achieved with the following weightings: Community & Outreach - 5% Products & Integrations - 70% Governance & Identity - 10% Development & Infrastructure - 15%

Cost comparison Funding categories could have reduced the total overall cost by 90% for handling funding categorisation for fund 8 if it was fully used as an alternative approach. The methodology for this cost comparison is documented.

Funding categorisation properties Categorisation properties were defined and helped to determine which properties are desirable for funding categorisation. Funding categories apply the more effective properties by being broad, inclusive and recurring. Funding categories advantages over challenge settings Funding categories applying more effective categorisation properties means funding categories are more efficient, simple, flexible, scalable, egalitarian and good for effectively directing funding and promoting healthy competition.

Notes

Further Consideration on funding categories Having the community vote on the future direction of Cardano Project Catalyst is a fundamental part of the governance process of the Cardano treasury. An innovation fund can not provide funding in all important directions and needs to be nimble enough to change direction when required. Providing full funding to set categories adds efficiency into the setting of a general fund but removes the ability to offer specific funding to focus on a problem area. Therefore, a balance is looking to be struck between efficient operations and community lead governance. The exact mix between consistent categories and community voted focus could be considered a ‘parameter’ that could be explored as a community adjustment on a fund by fund basis, at regular (parameter set) intervals, or a more complex fund by fund voting mechanism. An alternative is that the experiment with side treasuries continues and the successful operation of these will offer a broader base of participation to specific requirements of subsets of the community.
