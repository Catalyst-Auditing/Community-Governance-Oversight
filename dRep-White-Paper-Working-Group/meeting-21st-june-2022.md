The F8 Community Governance Oversight proposal intent is to examine changes in Project Catalyst Governance. This includes Challenge Setting, Catalyst Circle Problem Sensing, Parameter Changes. And what we're doing here, oversight of D reps.

[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=64s) - White Paper Overview - Kenric Nelson

In the last Fund 7 part of this we completed a literature review and now we're moving forward with a white paper.&#x20;

The basic way that the team is structured is around three roles.  Stephen, myself (Kenric) and Thorston are going to act as editors of the white paper. Then there is four or five people who have stepped up to be a lead author for a section of the white paper.&#x20;

Once we have progressed further I plan to have some community input to review the paper before we finalize it.

### Aharon Porath (Consenz)

[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=167s) - Aharon Porath - Consenz

I am the founder of Consenz.&#x20;

Which is another funded proposal from Project Catalyst. During Fund eight, we submitted and had approved a proposal for creating research in the accelerated digital identity challenge to build a different framework for governance and voting.&#x20;

We named this proposal _DID for Democracy on the Blockchain_ ([Ideascale link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396670)).&#x20;

We are also working with the CA and the vCA communities in order to provide them a tool for creating guidelines. And we are starting to research how we can use the digital identity technology  to create a variety of voting mechanisms on our platform.&#x20;

Right now the main role of voting in Cardano is on proposals and for the use of the Treasury. We hope that when the first version of Consenz platform is ready we can it to explore different kinds of influence in governance, like a creating a document that can act as the code of conduct or constitution.&#x20;

By integrating principles of liquid democracy and other systems we can gain experience and really see how voting mechanisms work in real use before we implement them in the Catalyst process.

### Frank Albanese (Snapbrillia)

[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=311s) - Frank Albanese (Snapbrillia)

I am Frank Albanese currently CSO at Snapbrilla. We had two proposals in Fund 8. Around our Mentor-mentee bounty network ([Mentor-mentee Bounties & eLearning](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397419)) , similar to [gitcoin ](https://gitcoin.co/)but for Cardano, and then our quadratic voting and funding research work ([OpenSource Quadratic Voting Funding](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396834)). We have a Haskell Plutus team of around 25 engineers right now. And we're working through architecting systems that help with Sybil attack defense mechanisms.

With our with SSI research we will hopefully provide users with a proof of reputation platform. Starting with Hyperledger Aries integration ([ATALA Prism ZKP + Hyperledger Aries](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414008)),then with Atala prism working on the Roots wallet and RootsID teams, and Tony Rose and the team from IOG around Prism.&#x20;

Really, what I'm curious about is, you know, I'd love to document the way we're looking at, like the UTX o model, and how that actually, and Kendrick was on our call only an hour ago. But we're just talking about, you know, ways in which there are some attack vectors that are exposed through having a hyperlocal state, like with the UTX o model. And the way you accomplish like a local global state with either like a djed NFT where there's an issuer and holder model, or there's this SSI approach with like a CL credential and forming a voting record, and how that can be expanded.
