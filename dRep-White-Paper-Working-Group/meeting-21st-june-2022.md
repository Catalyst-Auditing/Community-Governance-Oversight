The F8 Community Governance Oversight proposal intent is to examine changes in Project Catalyst Governance. This includes Challenge Setting, Catalyst Circle Problem Sensing, Parameter Changes. And what we're doing here, oversight of D reps.

[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=64s) - White Paper Overview - Kenric Nelson

In the last Fund 7 part of this we completed a literature review and now we're moving forward with a white paper.&#x20;

The basic way that the team is structured is around three roles.  Stephen, myself (Kenric) and Thorston are going to act as editors of the white paper. Then there is four or five people who have stepped up to be a lead author for a section of the white paper.&#x20;

Once we have progressed further I plan to have some community input to review the paper before we finalize it.

### Aharon Porath - Consenz

[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=167s) - Aharon Porath - Consenz

I am the founder of Consenz.&#x20;

And I another funded proposal from the from the project catalyst. During a fund eight, we have submitted and approved and been approved by a proposal for creating research for the accelerated digital identity challenge for building different framework for voting for governance and voting.&#x20;

We named this as proposal democracy on the blockchain.&#x20;

And I think that while we are here, speaking about the direct role, and how we can implement liquid democracy into this role, we are also working with the CIA and the BCA communities in order to provide them a tool for creating guidelines, then we are started researching how we can use the digital identity technology in order to create a variety of voting influence and voting mechanism to hold our platform.&#x20;

So while the right now the main voting in in caradonna, as a whole, the main role of voting is on proposals on for the on the use of the Treasury. We hope that after our MVP after the first version of consensus platform ready, we can use this we can use it in order to explore different kinds of influence in governance, like a creating a document that can act as the code of conduct or constitution.&#x20;

And by integrating those principles of liquid democracy and other systems. We can gain experience and really see how this voting mechanism work in real use before we can implement them on the catalyst process and on to further
