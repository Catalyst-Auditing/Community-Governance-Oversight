The F8 Community Governance Oversight proposal intent is to examine changes in Project Catalyst Governance. This includes Challenge Setting, Catalyst Circle Problem Sensing, Parameter Changes. And what we're doing here, oversight of D reps.

[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=64s) - White Paper Overview - Kenric Nelson

In the last Fund 7 part of this we completed a literature review and now we're moving forward with a white paper.&#x20;

The basic way that the team is structured is around three roles.  Stephen, myself (Kenric) and Thorston are going to act as editors of the white paper. Then there is four or five people who have stepped up to be a lead author for a section of the white paper.&#x20;

Once we have progressed further I plan to have some community input to review the paper before we finalize it.

### Aharon Porath (Consenz)

[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=167s) - Aharon Porath - Consenz

I am the founder of Consenz.&#x20;

Which is another funded proposal from Project Catalyst. During Fund eight, we submitted and had approved a proposal for creating research in the accelerated digital identity challenge to build a different framework for governance and voting.&#x20;

We named this proposal _DID for Democracy on the Blockchain_ ([Ideascale link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396670)).&#x20;

We are also working with the CA and the vCA communities in order to provide them a tool for creating guidelines. And we are starting to research how we can use the digital identity technology  to create a variety of voting mechanisms on our platform.&#x20;

Right now the main role of voting in Cardano is on proposals and for the use of the Treasury. We hope that when the first version of Consenz platform is ready we can it to explore different kinds of influence in governance, like a creating a document that can act as the code of conduct or constitution.&#x20;

By integrating principles of liquid democracy and other systems we can gain experience and really see how voting mechanisms work in real use before we implement them in the Catalyst process.

### Frank Albanese (Snapbrillia)

[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=311s) - Frank Albanese (Snapbrillia)

I am Frank Albanese currently CSO at Snapbrilla. We had two proposals in Fund 8. Around our Mentor-mentee bounty network ([Mentor-mentee Bounties & eLearning](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397419)) , similar to [gitcoin ](https://gitcoin.co/)but for Cardano, and then our quadratic voting and funding research work ([OpenSource Quadratic Voting Funding](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396834)). We have a Haskell Plutus team of around 25 engineers right now. And we're working through architecting systems that help with Sybil attack defense mechanisms.

With our with SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) research we will hopefully provide users with a proof of reputation platform. Starting with [Hyperledger Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries) integration ([ATALA Prism ZKP + Hyperledger Aries](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414008)) then with Atala prism working on the Roots wallet and RootsID teams and [Tony Rose](https://iohk.io/jp/team/tony-rose) and the team from IOG around Prism.&#x20;

What I am curious about is how to document the way we're looking at the UTXO model.

We were just talking about ways in which there are some attack vectors that are exposed through hyperlocal states, like with the [UTXO model](https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/eutxo-explainer). And the way you can accomplish a local global state with either a Djed NFT where there's an issuer and holder model. Or there is this SSI approach with like a CL credential and forming a voting record, and how that can be expanded.

### Kenric Nelson (Photrek)

[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=423s) - Kenric Nelson (Photrek)

I am the founder of [Photrek](https://photrek.world/). We have been providing a variety of different insights about how complex systems can help understand governance processes within the Catalyst community. And Photrek has complementary efforts in machine intelligence and also in Environmental Science sensors. And I am really looking forward to working with you all. It's been a pleasure working with Stephen and I think this is going to be an exciting effort.

### Philip Lazos (IOG)

[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=489s) - Philip Lazos (IOG)

Hello, I'm a [research fellow at IOG](https://iohk.io/jp/team/philip-lazos). I used to work in academia researching theoretical computer science, games, auctions, incentives and the like. In the last year or so I've been working full time in IOG on the research side on a variety of projects involving consensus or incentives. Thank you.

### Steph Macurdy (Wolfram)

### Stephen Whitenstall (QADAO)

[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=538s) - Stephen Whitenstall (QADAO)

[QADAO ](https://quality-assurance-dao.github.io/)was funded in Catalyst Fund 5. I have 30 years experience in quality assurance, test program management, project management and social enterprise. Most recently, I completed a degree in philosophy and became interested in Catalyst from that perspective.&#x20;

&#x20;QADAO provides a lot of project management for several governance projects in Catalyst. And we are also quite well known for documentation. Picking up on what Frank raised about UTXO documentation - QADAO is concerned with how to communicate technical subjects in a way that is easily understandable, to help onboard people and to understand the risks and the quality issues involved with that. Thank you. We have quite an exciting group of people here.

### Thorsten Pottebaum (adanamics)&#x20;

[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=597s) - Thorsten Pottebaum (adanamics)

I have been part of Catalyst since last year and have been involved in a number of topics. Lately working with Stephen W on audit and also on governance. I was also part of the team who did the DAO literature review (Fund 7 - Communty Governance Oversight).\
\
In my day to day life I work as an audit program manager for an international med tech company. And I have a postgraduate degree in Computer System Security.

### Organization of white paper

[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=699s) -  Kenric

As I mentioned the way we're organizing the team is that myself, Thorsten and Stephen will act as editors of the whole white paper. And then each of you lead a section.

There are some natural synergies so as we go forward we may change the arrangement a little bit. There also can be some overlap in terms of how we work together.&#x20;

Presently the white paper has an introduction written during our literature review. For the moment I'm keeping that. but that's likely to change. It includes a little diagram of what liquid democracy is.

The reason we're focused on this is because it is foundation for what is proposed as the delegated representative process for Catalyst. We are viewing our mission to identify what measurements need to be done to understand the integrity, dynamics and quality of the community's representation.&#x20;

#### Banzhaf power index

[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=790s)

A significant part of our work has been getting a deeper understanding of what's called the [Banzhaf power index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf\_power\_index).&#x20;

This is a way of measuring the probability that an individual in a voting system has the ability to change the outcome of a decision. It is a kind of combinatorial analysis about how often you are a decisive voter versus someone who's not influential in the outcome.&#x20;

The two extremes are, if your probability is zero that means you're what's called a **dummy vote**, and you're not actually influencing any of the decisions.&#x20;

And then the other extreme is if your probability is one, then you're a **dictator** and you are actually making the choice for the committee about all of the decisions.&#x20;

#### Authors, editors and co-authors

[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=899s)

Steph Macurdy has worked with me on understanding a paper about Banzchaf power index voting power in delegated Rep voting systems ("[Power in Liquid Democracy](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AAAI-7700.ZhangY.pdf)"). And he has also identified some Wolfram tools that have already been built to do this measurement.&#x20;

Philip Lazos is the co author of an important paper that IOG published at the beginning of the year on blockchain governance. An overview lots of different systems (see [paper ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07188)and [analysis](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/ekphrasis/february-2022/blockchain-governance-principles)).

The the editors can also be co authors on some of the sections if they are planning to dig into a particular section and contribute writing to it.&#x20;

A couple of you are already preparing contributions to a section and then also working together to build from that and put an independent white paper together on that topic. So Aharon Porath, is one case of that.&#x20;

Finally, Frank and the Snapbrilla team are particularly in interested what identity security is required for blockchain governance. Particularly once you move beyond one coin, one vote and require security about the identity of who is voting. Where Snapbrilla are building a quadratic voting funding system the issue of preventing Sybil attacks is also quite important.&#x20;

## Roles for each section

Discussion & commitments

[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=1083s) - Kenric

* Each section will have a topic - owner of the topic
* Provisional commitments for each section.

### The role of Delegated Representation in Blockchain Governance

#### Author(s): Philip Lazos

* Explain the pros and cons of delegated representation
* Current literature; application to Catalyst
* Show increases relative power of smaller stakeholders

[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0hppsP670k\&t=1101s) - Philip Lazos

So it all depends on how much available time I'm going to have, and how long the session this section will be. So given the title, I can think of a few things to say, off the order of a couple pages explaining why like delegated representation is useful, particularly for Project catalysts. But this is basically abstract enough to be applied to too many settings that face similar challenges. So something of this sort of length and at a high level, I think is it's possible that I don't know how much we want to expand and what the scope of it should be.
