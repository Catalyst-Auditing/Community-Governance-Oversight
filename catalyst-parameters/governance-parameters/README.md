# Governance parameters

## Overview

The intent of the Fund 7 Community Governance Overisght proposal is to provide community oversight of improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance by collecting feedback and providing tracking, documentation and analysis of any proposed changes.

This was originally motivated by the Catalyst Parameters Pilot. See extract from the[ Fund 7 proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383517) below -

> IOG have announced a Catalyst Parameters Pilot with the goal to decentralise the current governance process in respect of parameter changes to Project Catalyst.
>
> See Harris Warren's presentation on Catalyst Parameters governance process at Catalyst Circle V2 Meeting #2 - [https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle-oversight-v2/meetings/meeting-2-november-25th-2021#harris-warren-presentation-on-catalyst-parameters-governance-process-29-22](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle-oversight-v2/meetings/meeting-2-november-25th-2021#harris-warren-presentation-on-catalyst-parameters-governance-process-29-22)
>
> The strategy is to iterate a parameter change process between Catalyst Circle, a Catalyst Technical Council and the wider community.
