## Agenda

## Welcome

#### Stephen Whitenstall - [00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyq0BKlsD1I\&t=2s)

You can refer to this Agenda as a record of who attended and a summary of the content of our meeting.

We usually have a 45 minute recorded session and then have an informal unrecorded session afterwards. There's references here for the documentation.&#x20;

## Brief Updates

{% hint style="info" %}
Brief Updates/Notices from each participant - All
{% endhint %}

#### Stephen Whitenstall - 00:02

And we usually have a brief update from each participant. So maybe we can just as a few of us here, just a sentence or two.

I am Stephen Whitenstall of QADAO. I am part of the Community Governance Oversight proposal which includes this dRep Working Group.

#### Kenric Nelson - 02:34

I'm Kenric, I lead a company called Photrek and I am really thrilled to be working with Steve and the team as part of oversight of governance and this dRep paper. It's really coming together. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

#### Andrii Volostyn - 03:00

Hello, everyone. I'm Andre. I'm in Catalyst from Fund one.&#x20;

I have been a proposer, a CA and a vCA. I'm interested in blockchain governance, and in governance in general. So I submitted an application to be a dRep. And two weeks ago on the After Townhall there was a group on this. So I left  many comments in that white paper. Thanks for inviting me.&#x20;

#### Jack Briggs - 03:46

I'm Jack. I work for IOG and I'm part of the team that are rolling out delegation, dReps and many other things for governance.&#x20;

#### Steph Macready - 03:49

Hello, I'm Steph. I work at Wolfram Blockchain Labs, which is a subsidiary of Wolfram Research. I am part of writing this white paper focused on the measuring the influence of voter power using the Banzhaf Power Index .

#### Aharon Porath - 04:23&#x20;

I'm Aharon, the founder of Consenz,  a platform we're building for documenting decision making processes in a decentralised manner. We have been funded by the Catalyst project and we are also writing together with Kenric a chapter in the white paper for providing clear consensus and communication for governance.

#### Harry Hellyer - 05:05

My name is Harry Hillier. I run a coaching consultancy firm called edify with a set of partners. And then we run Edified co Labs.&#x20;

We work with a lot of technology firm, corporates and mid tier firms. So what's my value in this conversation? It will be to come at it more from a business point of view as opposed to a technical point of view. So rather than it being an objective perspective, it will be a business development strategy.

#### Thorsten Pottebaum - 05:52

Hello I am Thorsten. I am a Co-Editor. Some of you may have meet me already in the After Town Hall.

#### Chris Keller - 06:28

Hi, Stephen, good to see you. Again. I am here in support of QA DAO, the Challenge teams and the Circle and all pieces of Catalyst. I'm here pleasantly absorbing the dRep conversation and maybe won't be adding today I'm burdened with kids. But here for all the work you guys are doing with us.

## Research Budget

#### Kenric Nelson - updates - 06:50

We received the final payment from CGO Treasury for this project. And I've also forwarded a payment for Thorston for his work this month on being the co-editor. Later in the month we'll make final decisions with regard to rewards for the reviewers.

## Project Planning Update

#### Stephen Whitenstall - updates - 07:44

On the project planning side, I'll just refer to the previous Fund 7 CGO proposal which we have now done a closing report and we will be doing a presentation at Town Hall tomorrow.\
\
In that presentation there will be a reference to the predecessor of this working group, which was a DAO literature review. Then this project will be referred to as the successor of that. So watch out for that in the After Town Hall tomorrow.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

#### Kenric Nelson - 08:30

Looking at the calendar the team had made a request to not hold as many meetings during August, but I wanted to kind of press forward. So we did have two meetings this month, but I'm going to suggest that the meeting for the 30th August 2022 be cancelled or postponed.

I'm going to make a recommendation that rather than waiting a full month that we meet on 1800 UTC, September 6th 2022 as our next meeting for this group.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Next meeting :** 1800 UTC, Tuesday, September 6th, 2022
{% endhint %}

Looking at the month of September my recommendation is the 6th September 2022 include this whole team with the reviewers again. And then the 20th September 2022 be just the author's. And that's when we're going to finalise everything.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Authors/Editors meeting :** 20th September 2022
{% endhint %}

If anyone wants to make input into the review of the dRep white paper they should be doing it this week. So can \[Thorsten] get on Catalyst social media, and provide a link to the white paper and let people know that. You know, they should make their input this week, if they want to contribute to the review.&#x20;

Maybe the 14th of September 2022 might be a good time to do another after town hall discussion before we release the paper ?

## Community Review of dRep White Paper

#### Kenric Nelson - 14:16

Some updates on the organisation of this.&#x20;

The title page will just have the editors now because the way we're doing this kind of more like in the structure of a book chapter or journal.&#x20;

So we have a whole group of authors but the authors are only responsible for their section. And then I also put a table of contents together.&#x20;

The editors are putting together an introduction.&#x20;

Philip Lazos is putting together a literature review on delegated representation.

Steph Macready is going into more depth on the analytical side of how you measure power in delegated systems.&#x20;

Finally, we'll conclude with Aharon Porath who's applying governance to the process of consensus in writing a document.&#x20;

To make sure that we're also giving time and depth to Aaron's work, I'd like to start with that today.

Andrew Fisher is not is not apparently able to join us today. But he did a really deep dive and was quite helpful. Have you had a chance to look at his comments, Aaron?
