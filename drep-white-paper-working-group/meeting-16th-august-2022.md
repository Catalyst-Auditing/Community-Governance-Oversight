And we usually have a brief update from each participant. So maybe we can just as a few of us here, just a sentence or two.

I am Stephen Whitenstall of QADAO. I am part of the Community Governance Oversight proposal which includes this dRep Working Group.

#### Kenric Nelson - 02:34

I'm Kenric, I lead a company called Photrek and I am really thrilled to be working with Steve and the team as part of oversight of governance and this dRep paper. It's really coming together. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

#### Andrii Volostyn - 03:00

Hello, everyone. I'm Andre. I'm in Catalyst from Fund one.&#x20;

I have been a proposer, a CA and a vCA. I'm interested in blockchain governance, and in governance in general. So I submitted an application to be a dRep. And two weeks ago on the After Townhall there was a group on this. So I left  many comments in that white paper. Thanks for inviting me.&#x20;

#### Jack Briggs - 03:46

I'm Jack. I work for IOG and I'm part of the team that are rolling out delegation, dReps and many other things for governance.&#x20;

#### Steph Macready - 03:49

Hello, I'm Steph. I work at Wolfram Blockchain Labs, which is a subsidiary of Wolfram Research. I am part of writing this white paper focused on the measuring the influence of voter power using the Banzhaf Power Index .

#### Aharon Porath - 04:23&#x20;

I'm Aharon, the founder of Consenz,  a platform we're building for documenting decision making processes in a decentralised manner. We have been funded by the Catalyst project and we are also writing together with Kenric a chapter in the white paper for providing clear consensus and communication for governance.
