### General Updates&#x20;

#### Kenric Nelson

Goal for July 2022 is to have a solid draft each section of the White paper. The target for each section is between 3 to 5 pages.

We intend to be ready in August 2022 to invite the Catalyst community to provide reviews. And then in September 2022 to incorporate that feedback and complete our work.

George and Frank likely out of picture for the present.

Discussions with Thorsten & Steve concluded that we should focus on a good introduction for White Paper. As the lead editor, I should lead that writing that \[introductory] section.&#x20;

Once others have made progress \[...] I can write two to three sentences introducing your section.

I have been reading the \[available] papers on the pros and cons of liquid democracy and vote delegation.&#x20;

There are a couple of models that people have used to study vote delegation \[that each have] a few different objectives.&#x20;

And most of the papers have pessimistic results.&#x20;

At a first reading of the \[papers] abstracts this seems like a massive revelation. That they have uncovered the dirty secrets of liquid democracy.&#x20;

But when you check the models they are using it becomes pretty clear that under \[those] benchmarks liquid democracy, in the worst case, will look \[always] bad.

In response to this, there are a few papers that have come out recently that \[formed] a critique of the critique of liquid democracy. They explain that the previous modelling may be inaccurate and the worst case analysis, which is pretty standard when studying algorithms, is too pessimistic to be to be used here.&#x20;

For instance the first significant paper on vote delegation \[and] liquid democracy. Essentially, two properties are defined. One of them is called _positive gain_, which is how much better the outcome can be. And the other is the _do no harm_.&#x20;

\[Using] a model that can also be criticized, I'll explain it in a bit. They say that there is no mechanism that always has positive gains, and never makes the result worse.&#x20;

In isolation this sounds interesting. But actually, what this means is that you could have a mechanism that in most cases actually gives very good results.

But there could be some cases where it \[just] makes a really good outcome slightly less good.

Stated as properties, it seems that this mechanism has the potential to produce worse results, as well as better. Because they don't really go into how much better the good results are compared to no delegation, and how much worse the bad ones are.&#x20;

So papers started looking into it. And saying, hang on, these negative results are there. But all this means that is a vote that was going to go perfectly without delegation is going to go almost perfectly using delegation.&#x20;

So technically it became a bit worse. But the potential benefits \[that outweigh this] is that a vote that would have produced a bad result without delegation \[can now] produce a better one with the delegation.



&#x20;

So essentially, the way the first paper presented, it was not particularly fair.&#x20;

The other criticism of that original paper is that the assumption was that every voter there's two outcomes, one outcome is the correct one of the vote, and the other is the wrong one. And every voter has a chance independently of voting for the correct outcome. And also the chance of voting for the correct outcome for every voter is greater than 0.5.&#x20;

This is an assumption on that paper and most of the subsequent ones. The problem here is if we consider such a model, it quickly becomes clear that the more voters you have, if all of them have a greater than half chance of picking the correct outcome. The more voters you have, the higher the probability that you select, the good outcome becomes just by having more voters.&#x20;

Okay. So if you do delegation, even if the voters delegates to others who are more informed than them,

Next two or three days.

What is the focus ? A couple of models people have used to study.

Negative results - but when model checked - worst case.

A few papers coming out recently - worst case analysis is too pessimistic

First significant paper - two properties it defined - positive gain / do no harm

No mech for always positive - mech in most cases - a really good outcome less good - range of results

Range of negative results - bad result without delegation - good result with delegation

Every voter's chance to vote is greater than 0.5 - the more voters you have the higher probability you have a good outcome.

1000s of voters on average - good outcome - decide to delegate that 1%&#x20;

Not realistic in terms of voter - Liquid demos is bad paper - rebutted by recent papers - Philip

\


How do you measure a good outcome? Participation requires motivation. Lose motivation  - maybe this can level Liquid - Aharon

Measure quality of outcome - chance that voters take outcome - prob that select good outcome - almost certain good outcome will win in majority cases -  Philip&#x20;

What is the chance of more than half voters -&#x20;

In terms of engagement - only paper addresses this - effort they put in - subtracted from personal utility - delegation game - no detailed results - Philip

All these papers from last 5 years - Philip

Thorsten to meet with Philip to refine drafts

Recommend Thorsten be co-author
