### General Updates&#x20;

#### Kenric Nelson

[06:06](https://youtu.be/vXErKcmM-iE?t=366)

Goal for July 2022 is to have a solid draft each section of the White paper. The target for each section is between 3 to 5 pages.

We intend to be ready in August 2022 to invite the Catalyst community to provide reviews. And then in September 2022 to incorporate that feedback and complete our work.

George and Frank likely out of picture for the present.

Discussions with Thorsten & Steve concluded that we should focus on a good introduction for White Paper. As the lead editor, I should lead that writing that \[introductory] section.&#x20;

Once others have made progress \[...] I can write two to three sentences introducing your section.

I have been reading the \[available] papers on the pros and cons of liquid democracy and vote delegation.&#x20;

There are a couple of models that people have used to study vote delegation \[that each have] a few different objectives.&#x20;

And most of the papers have pessimistic results.&#x20;

At a first reading of the \[papers] abstracts this seems like a massive revelation. That they have uncovered the dirty secrets of liquid democracy.&#x20;

But when you check the models they are using it becomes pretty clear that under \[those] benchmarks liquid democracy, in the worst case, will look \[always] bad.

In response to this, there are a few papers that have come out recently that \[formed] a critique of the critique of liquid democracy. They explain that the previous modelling may be inaccurate and the worst case analysis, which is pretty standard when studying algorithms, is too pessimistic to be to be used here.&#x20;

For instance the first significant paper on vote delegation \[and] liquid democracy. Essentially, two properties are defined. One of them is called _positive gain_, which is how much better the outcome can be. And the other is the _do no harm_.&#x20;

\[Using] a model that can also be criticized, I'll explain it in a bit. They say that there is no mechanism that always has positive gains, and never makes the result worse.&#x20;

In isolation this sounds interesting. But actually, what this means is that you could have a mechanism that in most cases actually gives very good results.

But there could be some cases where it \[just] makes a really good outcome slightly less good.

Stated as properties, it seems that this mechanism has the potential to produce worse results, as well as better. Because they don't really go into how much better the good results are compared to no delegation, and how much worse the bad ones are.&#x20;

Papers started looking into it. And saying, hang on, these negative results are there. But all this means that is a vote that was going to go perfectly without delegation is going to go almost perfectly using delegation.&#x20;

Technically it became a bit worse. But the potential benefits \[that outweigh this] is that a vote that would have produced a bad result without delegation \[can now] produce a better one with the delegation.

Essentially, the way the first paper \[was] presented was not particularly fair.

Another criticism of the original paper is the assumption that \[for] every voter there's two outcomes. One \[voting] outcome is correct and the other is wrong. And every voter has a chance independently of voting \[to select] the correct outcome. And the chance of voting for the correct outcome for every voter is greater than 0.5.&#x20;

This is an assumption of that paper and most of the subsequent ones. The problem \[with this] model is that it quickly becomes clear that the more voters you have (if all of them have a greater than half chance of picking the correct outcome) the higher the probability that you select the good outcome just by having more voters.&#x20;

[14:46](https://youtu.be/vXErKcmM-iE?t=886)

\[But] if you do delegation, even if the voters delegates to others who are more informed than them, because with delegation the pool of actual voters goes down, you don't have this large number effect.&#x20;

That guarantees that the more voters you add into the mix the more likely it is to get the optimal outcome.

Specifically, they cite various constructions that they have where essentially 1000s of voters that have a one half plus epsilon \[infinitesimally small positive quantity ?] chance of being right. But because there's 1000s of them, on average, it's way more likely that the good outcome will have more votes than the bad outcome.&#x20;

All of these decide to delegate to an expert, who has a 0.99 chance of being right. But because so many of them delegate, in the end, that 1% chance of the expert being right turns out to be worse than having a million people who are just barely informed vote.&#x20;

And this is not a particularly realistic outcome.

I don't think it's fair to say that every voter has an above average chance (above half) of being right. Because mathematically, it's almost guaranteed to give you a bad result for delegation. Because the more you delegate the more you lose these concentration bounds on the probabilities that the voters will, on average, vote in favor of the good outcome.&#x20;

So there's a couple of papers dealing with this model. And saying that liquid democracy is bad for this and that. And then there's a few others papers criticizing the first one \[by] explaining that the first results are too pessimistic. And showing that how under more sane circumstances vote delegation can actually improve the outcome, even with this benchmark.&#x20;

And specifically, there is also one very recent paper that does delegation for liquid democracy with one step rather than having re-delegation.&#x20;

I'm going to include these three lines of work. The original negative results and then the critique of them. Then the final paper covering one-step delegation and say a few things about what Catalyst is doing.&#x20;

#### Kenric Nelson - 17:17

That's sounds great. That's a really nice contribution to this because it gives a kind of high level view of what people have investigated. And what people are documenting as potential pros and cons, and the challenges of doing this kind of research and understanding exactly \[how] making forecasts might happen.&#x20;

#### Stephen Whitenstall - 17:46

It is very practical in terms of examining what assumptions people are making and how we need to examine those assumptions. Particularly where is there an extreme example. And what can you reasonably expect of the average voter.

#### How do you measure good outcome of voting ?

#### Aharon Porath - [18:11](https://youtu.be/vXErKcmM-iE?t=1091)

\[Firstly] I wonder how do you measure the good outcome of voting.

\[Secondly] those papers took \[assumed] a large participation \[which] also requires motivation.&#x20;

If you focus on direct democracy, direct voting, then you may lose some engagement. Because because not everybody has the same motivation and free time.&#x20;

\[But] if you focus on some kind of delegation then you can can bring those that are a motivated to participate in the voting. And maybe this can can level the the pros and cons of delegation and liquid democracy in comparison to direct voting.

#### Philip Lazos - 19:13

I have an answer to both questions.&#x20;

#### How they measure the quality of the outcome.&#x20;

So the first about how they measure the quality of the outcome.&#x20;

Almost every paper has the following model. There's two outcomes, let's say the good and the bad outcome. And the only thing we care about is the chance that the voters take the good outcome.

And the way they model the vote is that every voter has a probability of selecting a vote in favor of the good outcome.&#x20;

So let's say if there's just one voter whose probability of voting for the good outcome is 0.7.&#x20;

Then the score, let's say of the selection is 0.7. If we have a million voters with a probability 0.7 voting for the good outcome. Then it's almost certain that the good outcome will win.&#x20;

So this will have a score of one, because we're taking such a huge sample, it's very unlikely that even though everybody has a 70% chance of voting for the good thing, the bad event will happen.&#x20;

So that's the benchmark they using. Just a chance for every voter to do the right thing. What's the chance that more than half of the voters end voting in favor of the right outcome?&#x20;

#### Engagement effort

\[Secondly] In terms of the engagement effort, there is only one paper that seriously \[addresses this].&#x20;

And they do \[document] a relationship between how much effort somebody puts in, and how close to 1, the probability of voting for the right outcome becomes.

Essentially, from the voters perspective \[...] the effort they put in to increase their chance of voting for the good outcome is subtracted from their personal utility.&#x20;

In that model there is zero cost of delegating \[1] and non zero costs, going from zero to one, the more engaged the voter is when voting directly.&#x20;

Unfortunately this paper, other than setting the model and explaining what the rules of the game are, They call this the delegation game. There isn't any serious result. \[All] they show is one sort of bad Nash equilibrium of how that vote could go.  Everything else, like better delegation mechanisms, or other equilibria, they leave this as future work. So other than the conceptual contribution on the model it's not very definitive.&#x20;

One downside is that this is a pretty new area. All these papers are from the last five to 10 years. \[...] And I can say for a fact that \[no one] has actually run any election \[...] related to that research.&#x20;

#### Kenric Nelson - 23:28

I think part of keeping the scope realistic has been this idea that we're trying to lay out what should be measured. And it's for a later project actually do those measurements as the dReps within Catalyst evolve.\


#### Stephen Whitenstall - 23:57

There's a great opportunity here in using these models in real world use cases \[...] from a pragmatic perspective.
