There's no real project plan updates, we are continuing meetings. Things are proceeding smoothly. I will do a monthly report on the 24th July 2022 and mention that we're holding these meetings regularly.

### General Updates&#x20;

#### Kenric Nelson

Goal for July 2022 is to have a solid draft each section of the White paper. The target for each section is between 3 to 5 pages.

We intend to be ready in August 2022 to invite the Catalyst community to provide reviews. And then in September 2022 to incorporate that feedback and complete our work.

George and Frank likely out of picture for the present.

Discussions with Thorsten & Steve concluded that we should focus on a good introduction for White Paper. As the lead editor, I should lead that writing that \[introductory] section.&#x20;

Once others have made progress \[...] I can write two to three sentences introducing your section.

I have been reading the \[available] papers on the pros and cons of liquid democracy and vote delegation.&#x20;

There are a couple of models that people have used to study vote delegation \[that each have] a few different objectives.&#x20;

And most of the papers have pessimistic results.&#x20;

At a first reading of the \[papers] abstracts this seems like a massive revelation. That they have uncovered the dirty secrets of liquid democracy.&#x20;

But when you check the models they are using it becomes pretty clear that under \[those] benchmarks liquid democracy, in the worst case, will look \[always] bad.

In response to this, there are a few papers that have come out recently that \[formed] a critique of the critique of liquid democracy. They explain that the previous modelling may be inaccurate and the worst case analysis, which is pretty standard when studying algorithms, is too pessimistic to be to be used here.&#x20;

For instance the first significant paper on vote delegation \[and] liquid democracy. Essentially, two properties are defined. One of them is called _positive gain_, which is how much better the outcome can be. And the other is the _do no harm_.&#x20;

\[Using] a model that can also be criticized, I'll explain it in a bit. They say that there is no mechanism that always has positive gains, and never makes the result worse.&#x20;

In isolation this sounds interesting. But actually, what this means is that you could have a mechanism that in most cases actually gives very good results.

But there could be some cases where it \[just] makes a really good outcome slightly less good.

Stated as properties, it seems that this mechanism has the potential to produce worse results, as well as better. Because they don't really go into how much better the good results are compared to no delegation, and how much worse the bad ones are.&#x20;

Papers started looking into it. And saying, hang on, these negative results are there. But all this means that is a vote that was going to go perfectly without delegation is going to go almost perfectly using delegation.&#x20;

Technically it became a bit worse. But the potential benefits \[that outweigh this] is that a vote that would have produced a bad result without delegation \[can now] produce a better one with the delegation.

Essentially, the way the first paper \[was] presented was not particularly fair.

Another criticism of the original paper is the assumption that \[for] every voter there's two outcomes. One \[voting] outcome is correct and the other is wrong. And every voter has a chance independently of voting \[to select] the correct outcome. And the chance of voting for the correct outcome for every voter is greater than 0.5.&#x20;

This is an assumption of that paper and most of the subsequent ones. The problem \[with this] model is that it quickly becomes clear that the more voters you have (if all of them have a greater than half chance of picking the correct outcome) the higher the probability that you select the good outcome just by having more voters.&#x20;

[14:46](https://youtu.be/vXErKcmM-iE?t=886)

\[But] if you do delegation, even if the voters delegates to others who are more informed than them, because with delegation the pool of actual voters goes down, you don't have this large number effect.&#x20;

That guarantees that the more voters you add into the mix the more likely it is to get the optimal outcome.

Specifically, they cite various constructions that they have where essentially 1000s of voters that have a one half plus epsilon \[nfinitesimally small positive quantity ?] chance of being right. But because there's 1000s of them, on average, it's way more likely that the good outcome will have more votes than the bad outcome.&#x20;





All of these decide to delegate to an expert, who has a zero points 99 chance of being right. But because so many of them delegate, in the end, that 1% chance of the expert being right turns out to be worse than having a million people who are just barely informed vote. And this is not a particularly realistic outcome. Like I don't think it's fair to say that every voter has an above average chance, above half chance of being right. Because this mathematically, it's almost guaranteed to give you a bad result for the negation. Because the more you delegate, the more you lose these concentration bounds on the probabilities that the voters will, on average, vote in favor of the good outcome. So there's a couple of papers dealing with this model. And saying, you know, the liquid democracy is bad for this and that. And then there's a few others papers criticizing the first one explaining that the first results are a bit too pessimistic. And showing that how, under certain more sane circumstances, votes delegation can actually improve the outcome, even with this benchmark. And specifically, there is also one very recent paper that does that for delegation for liquid democracy with one step rather than having delegation read delegation. Okay. So basically, I'm gonna include these three lines of work the original negative results and say, then the critique of them. And then the final thing for once that delegation, say a few things about what capitalist is doing. Something like that, I think,

Next two or three days.

What is the focus ? A couple of models people have used to study.

Negative results - but when model checked - worst case.

A few papers coming out recently - worst case analysis is too pessimistic

First significant paper - two properties it defined - positive gain / do no harm

No mech for always positive - mech in most cases - a really good outcome less good - range of results

Range of negative results - bad result without delegation - good result with delegation

Every voter's chance to vote is greater than 0.5 - the more voters you have the higher probability you have a good outcome.

1000s of voters on average - good outcome - decide to delegate that 1%&#x20;

Not realistic in terms of voter - Liquid demos is bad paper - rebutted by recent papers - Philip

\


How do you measure a good outcome? Participation requires motivation. Lose motivation  - maybe this can level Liquid - Aharon

Measure quality of outcome - chance that voters take outcome - prob that select good outcome - almost certain good outcome will win in majority cases -  Philip&#x20;

What is the chance of more than half voters -&#x20;

In terms of engagement - only paper addresses this - effort they put in - subtracted from personal utility - delegation game - no detailed results - Philip

All these papers from last 5 years - Philip

Thorsten to meet with Philip to refine drafts

Recommend Thorsten be co-author
