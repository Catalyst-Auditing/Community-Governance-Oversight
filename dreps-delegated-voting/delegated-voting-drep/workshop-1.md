### Questions

**22:58** For a voter who normally votes on hundreds of proposals, is there an advantage to delegating to a dRep? &#x20;

**27:27** Can dReps also be proposers? &#x20;

**28:23** Are voting rewards paid per proposal?&#x20;

**30:12** Can dReps vote for their own proposals?  &#x20;

**30:31**  Are CA and VCA roles affected by the dRep mechanism?&#x20;

**31:07** How do we ensure that dReps vote for the right proposals? What is the “right” proposal? dRep rationales, not appeasing people, and being true to yourself&#x20;

**35:46** Will big teams with big marketing budgets have a centralising advantage in getting  dReps to support them? &#x20;

**36:43**  Code of ethics for dReps? &#x20;

**39:43**  What will be the main communication channel for dReps? &#x20;

**41:08** Can a dRep also have their own personal vote with their own wallet?

**42:50**  Representation and diversity – if a dRep is involved in a minority community and in writing proposals from that community, shouldn’t they be able to also vote on those proposals as a dRep, if their community wants that and trusts them, and they are transparent about it? &#x20;

**49:39** Who will decide who will become a dRep in later Funds?

**50:46** Can you be a dRep and also be on Catalyst Circle at the same time? &#x20;

**51:37** If you have a minimum number of proposals a dRep must vote on, will dReps only do the bare minimum required?&#x20;

**57:35** How is the maximum 1% of voting power calculated?

**58:11** Will there be a central location for information about dReps? &#x20;
