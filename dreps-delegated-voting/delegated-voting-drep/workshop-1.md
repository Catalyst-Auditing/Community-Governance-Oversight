## Questions (Session A)

**22:58** For a voter who is happy to vote on many proposals, is there any advantage to delegating to a dRep? &#x20;

**27:27** Can dReps also be proposers? &#x20;

**28:23** Are voting rewards paid per proposal?&#x20;

**30:12** Can dReps vote for their own proposals?  &#x20;

**30:31**  Are CA and VCA roles affected by the dRep mechanism?&#x20;

**31:07** How do we ensure that dReps vote for the right proposals? What is the “right” proposal? dRep rationales, not appeasing people, and being true to yourself&#x20;

**35:46** Will big teams with big marketing budgets have a centralising advantage in getting  dReps to support them? &#x20;

**36:43**  Code of ethics for dReps? &#x20;

**39:43**  What will be the main communication channel for dReps? &#x20;

**41:08** Can a dRep also have their own personal vote with their own wallet?

**42:50**  Representation and diversity – if a dRep is involved in a minority community and in writing proposals from that community, shouldn’t they be able to also vote on those proposals as a dRep, if their community wants that and trusts them, and they are transparent about it? &#x20;

**49:39** Who will decide who will become a dRep in later Funds?

**50:46** Can you be a dRep and also be on Catalyst Circle at the same time? &#x20;

**51:37** If you have a minimum number of proposals a dRep must vote on, will dReps only do the bare minimum required?&#x20;

**57:35** How is the maximum 1% of voting power calculated?

**58:11** Will there be a central location for information about dReps? &#x20;

Mainly a record of a certificate written to main net - CIP 36 (registration transaction) - Harris Warren - [45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=2742s)

**CIP 36 - Catalyst/Voltaire Registration Transaction Metadata Format** - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0036&#x20;

Transfer of full voting power would be ultimate solution & implementing a rule set - George - [46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=2782s)

We do have an initial set of tags - so you can filter by dRep domain knowledge - Harris Warren - [47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=2852s)&#x20;

What is selection criteria for dReps ? - Ninh - [49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=2952s)&#x20;

Open to anyone who has voted previously - requires delegators to stake to you - & proof of life - Jack Briggs - [49:36 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=2976s)

Yes - Jack Briggs - 50:17&#x20;

The bar to have Quadratic voting is to have KYC for Wallets (to prevent sybil attacks) - Ninh - [51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3070s)&#x20;

Quadratic sybil resistance Not aware of any high quality research done in prevention of those attacks - Getting benefits of partially doing KYC is something we are pursuing  - Philip Lazos - [51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3102s)

Interfaces & UI - will data be available publicly ? - with an open API - Darlington - [52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3154s)&#x20;

All interface powered by APIs and will be available openly - Some private GDPR data - Harris Warren - [53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3190s)&#x20;

Is API lagging behind the UI ? - Darlington - [53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3231s)&#x20;

### Wallet voting history

Wallet voting history - new wallet for dRep - previous voting history revealed ? - CA Wallet ? - Zoe - [54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3255s)&#x20;

dRep wallet can be new - proof of life can validate voting history with previous wallet address - Jack Briggs - [54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3286s)&#x20;

### Does dRep wallet need to contain 500 ADA ?

Not doing KYCs - so pseudonym possible - communications require an email - Harris Warren - [57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3446s)&#x20;

### Can dReps delegate to other dReps ?

At MVP we will not be able to delegate dRep to dRep - Jack Briggs - [58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3502s)&#x20;

### Is open discourse possible ?

Is the expectation that dReps will make siloed decisions or is open discourse possible ? - [59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3556s)&#x20;

We would encourage collaboration and open discourse - Jack Briggs - 59:34&#x20;

### Do people delegating to dReps get voting rewards ?&#x20;

Do people delegating to dReps get voting rewards ? - If dRep fails to reach 60/20 threshold does that mean they lose those rewards ? - Sebastian - [1:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBdacCIDOQ\&t=3613s)

Voter rewards are paid if you delegate your votes - Jack Briggs - 1:00:30

Voters are not impacted - it is the dRep who will not be rewarded - Jack Briggs - 1:01:26

How was the $3060

Where is 459 k coming from ? (3060 X 150) - Tommy - 1:01:39&#x20;
