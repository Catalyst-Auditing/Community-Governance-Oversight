## Antifragile Principles

#### &#x20;Antifragile Principles identified as relevant in Cataylst&#x20;

The follow Antifragile principles were identified by Dor Garbash in his "The Voltaire Principles" presentation :

* Decentralized custodianship over governance (no central entity controlling governance, any actor can be removed and governance still functions)
* Business as usual for Cardano end-users.
* Functional groups are represented: Voters, SPOâ€™s, Toolmakers & Maintainers, Funded proposers, Community advisors, Community proposal auditors (those who audit proposal reports), Challenge teams, Ambassadors
* Safe from adversarial capture.
* Accountability mechanisms.
* Understandable governance: Accessible and user-friendly documentation and rules.
* Transparency.
* Formal security and emergency mechanisms.
* Legitimate community leadership.
* Stable governance.
* Lively - not stagnant.
