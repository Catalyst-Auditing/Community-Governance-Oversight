# Antifragile Success criteria

## Antifragile Principles

#### &#x20;Antifragile Principles identified as relevant in Cataylst&#x20;

The follow Antifragile principles were identified by Dor Garbash in his "The Voltaire Principles" presentation :

* Decentralized custodianship over governance (no central entity controlling governance, any actor can be removed and governance still functions)
* Business as usual for Cardano end-users.
* Functional groups are represented: Voters, SPO’s, Toolmakers & Maintainers, Funded proposers, Community advisors, Community proposal auditors (those who audit proposal reports), Challenge teams, Ambassadors
* Safe from adversarial capture.
* Accountability mechanisms.
* Understandable governance: Accessible and user-friendly documentation and rules.
* Transparency.
* Formal security and emergency mechanisms.
* Legitimate community leadership.
* Stable governance.
* Lively - not stagnant.

## Decentralized custodianship over governance&#x20;

_Interpretation by Stephen Whitenstall_

In _Antifragile,_ Nassim Nicholas Taleb refers to the irony of Voltaire periodically seeking refuge in Switzerland for political and financial reasons (_Antifragile pg.86)._ Taleb suggests that the "_shelter, safety and stability_" of Switzerland can be attributed to its lack of a "large _central_ government".

The Swiss model is bottom-up and municipal government by regional entities called cantons.

Taleb empathizes how Swiss governance is dictated by a bottom-up and unintellectual atmosphere. Resistant to the dominance of any single big idea and nurturing local tinkering.

This decentralized governance approach is not scalable to the size of a nation state (what Taleb refers to as "_invariant under scale_" - _Antifragile_, pg.87). There is a difference in kind between the granularity of the governance of local affairs and the abstraction of large public expenditure.

Echoing [E. F. Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\_Is\_Beautiful), Taleb suggests that "Small is beautiful" (_Antifragile_, pg.89) in that a collection of small units is more antifragile than a large unit.&#x20;

## Business as usual&#x20;

In the context of business as usual success criteria represents a kind of stability based upon Antifragile principles. This kind of stability does not seek to eliminate volatility but rather to cancel it out in the aggregate. For example many variations are absorbed by many distributed decisions (what Taleb refers to as _Mediocristan_, _Antifragile_, pg.90).

How this success criteria will be met in practice will depend upon a kind of drip feed from a fragile centralised coporate body to an antifragile decentrailsed community bodies.

## Functional groups are represented

Taleb observes that the Swiss model encouraged vocational apprenticeship models. Or _know-how_ (_techne_) rather than _know-what_ (_episteme_)(_Antifragile_, pg. 90).

In the Cardano context the representation of functional groups can be seen to follow a _know-how_ approach where Voters, SPO’s, Toolmakers & Maintainers, Funded proposers, Community advisors, Community proposal auditors, Challenge teams and Ambassadors solicit contributions from apprentices.
