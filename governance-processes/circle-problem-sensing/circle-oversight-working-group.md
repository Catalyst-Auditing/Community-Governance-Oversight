### Overview

This meeting sought to clarify the problem sensing process. It referred back to the original "[Problem statement rubrik](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/activities/mvp-lists-of-prioritized-problems#catalyst-circle-aim)" defined by GovernanceAlive in July 2021. This was then compared with Nadia Hopkin's [CA/vCA Issues Log, Fund 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwJI3pv8esPCSPRPc4b2HEnrSd9xnwU8B5kQooJ89Q4/edit?usp=sharing).&#x20;

### The Problem statement rubrik

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-04-17 (3).png>)

The Problem statement rubrik was intended to clarify the Circle Problem Sensing process by providing criteria to assess a Prioritized Problem.

* What problem do you see?
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?&#x20;
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?&#x20;
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?
