### Overview

This meeting sought to clarify the problem sensing process. It referred back to the original "[Problem statement rubric](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/activities/mvp-lists-of-prioritized-problems#catalyst-circle-aim)" defined by GovernanceAlive in July 2021. This was then compared with Nadia Hopkin's [CA/vCA Issues Log, Fund 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwJI3pv8esPCSPRPc4b2HEnrSd9xnwU8B5kQooJ89Q4/edit?usp=sharing).

### The Problem statement rubric

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-04-17 (3).png>)

The Problem statement rubric was intended to clarify the Circle Problem Sensing process by providing criteria to assess a Prioritized Problem.

### Identify

* What problem do you see?

### Problem Statement

* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?

### Solution articulation

* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?

### Metrics

* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?

### How the rubric aligns with Circle

After some discussion the working group identified the following workflow for categorization of solutions to Prioritized Problems

### 1) A Proposal or Challenge

> Research questions and problem refinement

The Problem solution is either a Catalyst Proposal or Challenge Setting.

### 2) A specific decision.

> Decision making body and coordination for problem

The Problem solution requires alignment on a specific decision. Stakeholders must be consulted on a parameter or process change.

### Problem Ownership

The issue of Problem Ownership was discussed. Ownership is typically assigned naturally as a Circle Representative brings a Problem to Circle. But where there is ambiguity or the scope of the problem does not obviously align with a particular Circle Representative then someone must volunteer to steward the Problem.

### Taximony

Clarity is needed on what specific terms mean. For example -

A **sub-circle** - is some kind of community organization that supports problem sensing for a Circle Representative.

A **\[Community] issue** - is an issue posted to Circle but not raised as a Prioritized Problem.

A **Prioritized Problem or Problem** - is an issue that meets the Problem statement rubrik (above).

### **Overview**

This meeting built on the work of the previous meeting. We looked at how to describe the problem sensing rubric in accessible language and how to design a workflow for raising and reviewing a problem at a Circle meeting. Nadia Hopkins updated the group on how she had used the rubric while raising CA Prioritized Problems.

### **Problem Sensing**

Is the Problem Sensing rubric discussed previously sufficient as a minimum to move forward ?

### How do we describe the rubric ?

Discussion about how to describe the problem sensing rubric in simple language led to _categorizations_ such as -

> Problem scaffolding, Problem expression and framing a Problem

### **Prioritized Problem Process**

How does the Problem Sensing rubric structure the Prioritized Problem Process ?

> The group's first approach to the Prioritized Problem Process addressed entry onto the Problems Board and review of new Problems by Circle.

Ideation of a workflow for structuring this stage of the Problem process focused on the rubric expressed concisely as -

* importance to Catalyst mission
* the gap and the solution
* value quantitative / qualitative (metrics)

### The question of what minimum part of the rubric should be required to be put on the Problem Board backlog.

> Is it sufficient for a Problem to just address the importance to the Catalyst mission of it's resolution ?

{% hint style="info" %}
The conclusion was that 1) **importance to the Catalyst mission** & 2) some **articulation of the gap between the current state and an expected solution** be the minimum required to be placed in the Problem backlog.
