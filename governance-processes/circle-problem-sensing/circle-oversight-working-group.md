### Overview

This meeting sought to clarify the problem sensing process. It referred back to the original "[Problem statement rubrik](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/activities/mvp-lists-of-prioritized-problems#catalyst-circle-aim)" defined by GovernanceAlive in July 2021. This was then compared with Nadia Hopkin's [CA/vCA Issues Log, Fund 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwJI3pv8esPCSPRPc4b2HEnrSd9xnwU8B5kQooJ89Q4/edit?usp=sharing).

### The Problem statement rubrik

The Problem statement rubrik was intended to clarify the Circle Problem Sensing process by providing criteria to assess a Prioritized Problem.

### Identify

* What problem do you see?

### Problem Statement

* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?

### Solution articulation&#x20;

* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?

### Metrics

* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?

### How the rubrik aligns with Circle

After some discussion the working group identified the following workflow for categoriztion of solutions to Prioritized Problems

### 1) A Proposal or Challenge

> Research questions and problem refinement

The Problem solution is either a Catalyst Proposal or Challenge Setting.

### 2) A specific decision.

> Decision making body and coordination for problem

The Problem solution requires alignment on a specific decision. Stakeholders must be consulted on a parameter or process change.

### Problem Ownership

The issue of Problem Ownership was discussed. Ownership is typically assigned naturally as a Circle Representative brings a Problem to Circle. But where there is ambiguity or the scope of the problem does not obviously align with a particular Circle Representative then someone must volunteer to steward the Problem.

### Taximony

Clarity is needed on what specific terms mean. For example -

A **sub-circle** - is some kind of community organization that supports problem sensing for a Circle Representative.

A **\[Community] issue** - is an issue posted to Circle but not raised as a Prioritized Problem.

A **Prioritized Problem or Problem** - is an issue that meets the Problem statement rubrik (above).
