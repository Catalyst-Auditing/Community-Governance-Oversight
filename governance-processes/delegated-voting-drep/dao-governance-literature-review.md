### Overview

This meeting aimed to address tough questions for governance design.

* To investigate bottom up principles and tensions that arise in a community with natural competitiveness
* What type of decentralised organisation is most effective ?
* How to uphold principles of decentralised governance and stay competitive ?
* How to shift from invite to general community involvement
* Produce a white paper over a 3 to 4 month period

### Brief intro to Zotero tool

Kenric gave a short introduction to the Zotero research reference tool

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Action :** setup biweekly meeting for DAO literature review - Kenric / Stephen
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Our Focus :** "Measuring voting power in Catalyst D-reps"
{% endhint %}

### 1) recommendations for searches and/or papers to add to the database

{% hint style="success" %}
**Action :** identify questions & challenges for literature review - All
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Action :** add tags to identify papers relevant to measurement of d-rep implementation

### 2) selecting a few key articles to provide 1-3 page reviews.

For example in the "Liquid democracy" category the paper "Power in Liquid Democracy", Yuzhe Zhang and Davide Grossi (2010)

* What is the power of my vote ?
* Vote on proposals - what point do I not have a voice ?
* Voting power not proportional to a weighting but to an approx quadratic measure ?

### 3) Planning for a community white paper

> This is contingent on a successful Fund 8 vote for [Community Governance Oversight](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398225).

### Overview

After preliminary Zotero housekeeping, discussion moved onto Liquid Democracy papers.

### Context

[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1059s)

For context the papers we're looking at is background for D reps. Papers that are relevant to liquid democracy and in the context of IOGs implementation of D reps. - **Stephen**

Particularly methodologies for measuring power in these kinds of voting systems. - **Kenric**

[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1137s)

I'm not necessarily looking for this literature review to provide answers. But rather to help provide some guidance to the community about what the important questions are on these issues. And in defining good questions, I'm hoping to kind of motivate research and development within the community to try to tackle some of these questions. - **Kenric**

And the other contextual point is that this is part of an effort by Governance Oversight to do surveys within the community. A survey of the literature as a way to inform a more in depth conversation with the community and with IOG, with regard to the designs, and expectations we should have about the outcomes of the direct process. - **Kenric**

[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1240s)

Community Governance Oversight is a proposal that was submitted to Project Catalyst. It was jointly prepared with the community, IOG, Dor and Harris to oversee governance processes. It was funded in Fund 7, it may be funded in Fund 8. Part of that is to oversee D reps, Catalyst Circle Problem Sensing and Challenge Setting. - **Stephen**

### Review of "Power in Liquid Democracy"

What I'd like to do is use the tags to put our names so that we have a record of who provided the entry. So on your note, if you can add a tag with your name, that will be helpful. - **Kenric**

### Brief Summary

[26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1571s)

The paper develops a theory of power for delegable proxy voting systems.&#x20;

It defines a power index to measure the influence of voters and delegators.&#x20;

A formal theory of power with a delegated proxy was lacking.

So the aim was to provide a theory to gain insight into how power may have been to be distributed among agents.&#x20;

The authors analytically study the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

What does Nash equilibrium mean? Nash equilibrium is the most common way to define the solution of a non cooperative game involving two or more players. Each player is assumed to know the equilibria rooms, strategies of other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy.&#x20;

I think that might be helpful for just explaining what's the the importance of Nash equilibrium?  - **Steph**

{% endhint %}

### Portfolio allocation of voting power

[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1686s)

One of my immediate first thoughts was if people are delegating votes are we going to have a portfolio? Are we going to get to a point similar to how you allocate your financial portfolio? Are you going to do a portfolio allocation of voting power?&#x20;

If I have 100 votes am I going to be able to choose a little bit here or allocate a little bit there ? - **Steph**

28:41

From what IOG has communicated that is the intent. They haven't rolled it out yet. But part of the idea behind liquid democracy and the plans for the delegated reps is that you wouldn't necessarily delegate all your power to one representative, but you might spread that power across several representatives. - **Kenric**

### **Researching dRep's background**

[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZEqGvLw7Zg\&t=1751s)

I envision a research report that says this delegate rep is experienced in a particular area. There is evidence of what they understand and their previous voting record.&#x20;

This is their Wallet account. This is what they currently hold. This is how long they've been participating.&#x20;

And instead of me knowing about those things intimately it is enough that I just I need to know the reputation of somebody.&#x20;

And if I feel strongly about it, then I'm 50% allocated to them. And if I just want to make sure I hedge myself, I'm 10% to the opposite extreme.&#x20;

In the paper, they reference something called Liquid feedback. A website called liquid feed.  - **Steph**

### Steph's Notes on "Power in Liquid Democracy"

**Steph Macurdy: The paper develops a theory of power for delegable proxy voting systems.** We define a power index able to measure the influence of both voters and delegators.

However, a formal theory of power in voting systems with delegable proxy is lacking. We aim at providing such a theory here, and use it to gain insights into how power may happen to be distributed among agents involved in decision-making with liquid democracy

We analytically study the existence of **pure strategy Nash equilibria in such a model**. Finally, by means of simulations, we study the effect of relevant parameters on the emergence of power inequalities in the model.

Nash equilibrium is the most common way to define the [solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution\_concept) of a [non-cooperative game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperative\_game) involving two or more players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy. (Wikipedia)

Delegable voting gives rise to so-called "transitive delegations."

Can either cast vote directly or delegate, passing votes one has accrued further to another proxy.&#x20;

1. Portfolio allocation of votes
2. Snapshot results of different governance implementations

Liquid Feedback - https://liquidfeedback.com/en/

Favoring preferences and secondary choice.

"The starting point of our paper is a controversial feature of liquid democracy: transitive delegations may in principle lead to disproportionate accrual of power, thereby harming the democratic legitimacy of the resulting vote."

"is a [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power\_\(social\_and\_political\)) index defined by the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of changing an [outcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome\_\(game\_theory\)) of a [vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting) where voting rights are not necessarily equally divided among the voters or [shareholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder)." - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf\_power\_index)
