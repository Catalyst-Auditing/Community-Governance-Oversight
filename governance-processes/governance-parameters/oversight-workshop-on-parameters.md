## Overview

This meeting sought to clarify the questions -

* What is a parameter change ?
* What is a parameter ?
* Who decides this ?

This [task ](https://github.com/Catalyst-Auditing/Community-Governance-Oversight-Coordination/issues/67)was assigned to Tevo Saks & Stephen Whitenstall by [Community Governance Oversight Meeting 4](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/project-management/meetings-and-town-halls/f7-meeting-3-7th-april-2022#5.4-governance-parameters).

## What is a parameter ?

A necessary process or change.

![What is a parameter change ?](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-03 100117.png>)

There will be quantitatively and qualitative parameters.

In terms of what must be documented, sufficient information should be available on current / expected state and who owns the change.

* Who "owns" the parameter?
* Scope of change - what is being changed (includes current state and expected state)
* Why this parameter is set in place? (How does it benefit the Cardano Mission?)
* How is the parameter effectiveness measured?

### Operational Parameters

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-04 110504.png>)

**Examples** - minimum pool cost, increasing block size.

## What types of parameter change are there ?

### Fixed values

discrete, particular, atomistic. A change to a fixed value or constant.

### Change to a process

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-04 103828 (1).png>)

Change to rules of how to conduct a process. Either a new or current process / parameter.

Example - vCA has to submit Quality Control assessments trough Google Form using Google Sheet link.

## Consequence of changing the parameter

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-04 105506.png>)

* **Low impact** - change to a fault tolerant process
* **High impact** - change to a fragile process
* **Low Auditability** - Lack of information and about the project and how the goals are achieved
* **High Auditability** - we have better view how the proposal will be completed

## **What is a parameter change?**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-03 134921.png>)

A parameter change is a change from a current state to a new state with a process of consultation.

## Who decides ?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-04 101539.png>)

**Stakeholders** who will be impacted by the parameter change. Anyone who controls the Intellectual Property.

A decision process is defined for the parameter that assigns ownership & identfies its scope.

### Example

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-04 101946.png>)

* A specific parameter is identified.
* Temporary ownership of the parameter is assigned to a decision making body.
* The change is voted on.

## How to make decisions in quorum?
