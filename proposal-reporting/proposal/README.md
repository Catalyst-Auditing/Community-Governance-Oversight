## **Detailed plan**

**Fill in here any additional details**

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

### **Overview**

As Project Catalyst evolves through rapidly scaling funds, improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance processes need oversight and assessment from the community.

### **Community Governance Oversight Proposal Intent**

This proposal's intent is to provide community oversight of improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance (incl. the Catalyst Parameters Pilot below) by collecting feedback and providing tracking, documentation and analysis of any proposed changes.

A complementary proposal "_Catalyst Audit Circle_" ( [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Audit-Circle/381354-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Audit-Circle/381354-48088) ) will provide oversight on funded proposals and fund ongoing liaison with the Catalyst Auditing working group.

In Fund 8, four governance processes will be live. Three of them are addressed by this proposal, viz:

**1. Challenge Setting.**

**2. Catalyst Circle problem sensing.**

**3. Modifying the governance parameters** in Catalyst via Catalyst Circle and a Technical Counsel. (see below for more details)

The intention of this proposal is to provide oversight on these three processes by the Community Governance Oversight Group.

The fourth governance process, **Funded proposals**, will have oversight by the complementary proposal Catalyst Audit Circle ( [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Audit-Circle/381354-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Audit-Circle/381354-48088) )

### **The Community Governance Oversight Process**

**1) Effective communication via surveys & workshops**

The Community Governance Oversight Group (hereafter, "the Oversight group") will create internal & external surveys that will provide analysis of the quality of decision-making of each governance process outlined above. These will be included in the final report for each governance process.

**Internal surveys**

Internal surveys will be directed at self assessment / lessons learnt by those who organize each governance process (the governance processes are Challenge Teams, Catalyst Circle & the Technical Council.)

**External surveys**

External surveys will be directed at the Catalyst community and their reception of each governance process ( e.g. The governance processes are Challenge Setting, Catalyst Circle Problem Sensing & governance parameters setting.)

**Workshops**

Members of the Oversight group will facilitate workshops After Town Hall to complement feedback monitoring and survey design.

**2) Facilitation of internal retrospectives**

The Oversight group will facilitate internal retrospectives that will address issues highlighted by the surveys and workshops, and identify improvement recommendations.

**3) Final Reports.**

The Oversight group will document and track the activities of any improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance making these easily accessible to the community.

Final reports checking whether actions to resolve or improve have been executed and recommending further improvements.

### **Catalyst Parameters Pilot**

IOG have announced a Catalyst Parameters Pilot with the goal to decentralise the current governance process in respect of parameter changes to Project Catalyst.

See Harris Warren's presentation on Catalyst Parameters governance process at Catalyst Circle V2 Meeting #2 - [https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle-oversight-v2/meetings/meeting-2-november-25th-2021#harris-warren-presentation-on-catalyst-parameters-governance-process-29-22](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle-oversight-v2/meetings/meeting-2-november-25th-2021#harris-warren-presentation-on-catalyst-parameters-governance-process-29-22)

The strategy is to iterate a parameter change process between Catalyst Circle, a Catalyst Technical Council and the wider community.

### **Success criteria**

An overview of success criteria was presented by Dor Gorbash on 8th December 2021 at Fund 7 Town Hall #5

### **Catalyst Technical Council**

The Catalyst Technical Council will comprise of :

_Dor Garbash, Kevin Hammond and Professor Roman Oliynykov_

* [https://iohk.io/en/team/dor-garbash](https://iohk.io/en/team/dor-garbash)
* [https://iohk.io/en/team/kevin-hammond](https://iohk.io/en/team/kevin-hammond)
* [https://iohk.io/en/team/roman-oliynykov](https://iohk.io/en/team/roman-oliynykov)

These experts will initially be appointed by IOG with the intention that, in time, they will be elected and establish a bicameral governance system with Catalyst Circle.

In time this will entail an expanded role for Catalyst Circle Administrators ( see [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CC-Admin-Team-Scope-Expansion/384245-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CC-Admin-Team-Scope-Expansion/384245-48088) ) and also necessitates a requirement for community oversight as outlined in this proposal.

### **Community Governance Oversight Objectives**

The Oversight group will seek to ensure that :

1. No central entity or authority controls improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance.
2. Key groups are fairly represented - such as Voters, SPOs, Toolmakers and Maintainers, Funded Proposers, Community Advisors, Challenge Teams and Cardano Ambassadors .
3. Activities of participants in any governance changes are accountable to the community.
4. The risk of adversarial capture is mitigated.
5. That governance is transparent and understandable through accessible, timely and widely distributed documentation and communication.
6. Will assess whether improvements to Catalyst Governance have :

* a) recruited capable participants,
* b) access to impartial data and analysis,
* c) robust methodologies,
* d) clear rules and policies.

7\. Formal security and emergency mechanisms are developed and implemented.

8\. Governance culture is legitimate, stable and lively.
