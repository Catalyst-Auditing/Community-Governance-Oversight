## Assessment One

### Impact / Alignment

Looking through the proposal one can see that the problem was well stated and their corresponding or proposed solutions have the effective measures to solve the problems. It's obvious that Project Catalyst evolves through rapidly scaling funds, improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance processes need oversight and assessment from the community hence the need for a governance oversight if the proposers are given funds.

### Feasibility

The plans presented looks attainable with definite timelines and broad deliverables. I'm also happy about the inclusion of the experiences that the proposers bring to the table. They have diverse backgrounds and that can help bring innovation to the project. I however think they should have included some challenges they think they might face in the implementation of the proposal and how they can work it out to be solved.

### Auditability

Given the problem statement the solutions provided, the plans and the experiences I think the proposal can be a success. It's clear there are some KPIs presented and they were obviously they can paint a picture of the success of the project.
