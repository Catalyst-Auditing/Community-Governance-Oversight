## Assessment One

### Impact / Alignment

Looking through the proposal one can see that the problem was well stated and their corresponding or proposed solutions have the effective measures to solve the problems. It's obvious that Project Catalyst evolves through rapidly scaling funds, improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance processes need oversight and assessment from the community hence the need for a governance oversight if the proposers are given funds.

### Feasibility

The plans presented looks attainable with definite timelines and broad deliverables. I'm also happy about the inclusion of the experiences that the proposers bring to the table. They have diverse backgrounds and that can help bring innovation to the project. I however think they should have included some challenges they think they might face in the implementation of the proposal and how they can work it out to be solved.

### Auditability

Given the problem statement the solutions provided, the plans and the experiences I think the proposal can be a success. It's clear there are some KPIs presented and they were obviously they can paint a picture of the success of the project.

## Assessment Two

### Impact / Alignment

Providing the community oversight of Catalyst governance processes is certainly an audit issue that needs addressing as lack of it we are told by this team, we will stagnate and lack accountability which is a risk that needs to be mitigated

### Feasibility

The team comprises of a wide range of expertise from various fields of study and experience in areas such as finance, academic research, accountancy, project management, entrepreneurship, community outreach, facilitation and development. This team seems to have a lot of goodwill towards the community and does not want it to fail in any way, I am confident that they will implement what they outline in the plan outlines as the oversight process and timelines outlined in the proposal

### Auditability

The proposal outlines the methods that they will use for the Oversight group to allow the Cardano community to have more information at a high level on the effectiveness of the proposal process & the Catalyst innovation fund in general. This group plays a critical role in the evolving decentralized Catalyst governance process, and will serve as an important area to test experiments that will flow into the Voltaire processes. The team has provided a detailed and sufficient plan for this to work

## Assessment Three

### Impact / Alignment

This proposal is in line with the challenge setting. The group’s goal is to provide more transparency to the cardano’s treasury resources by providing higher level information to the community. This part of the proposal does address the financial metric from the challenge setting. The group will also provide insight into the improvements and innovations in catalyst. By providing these insights, the group can help the cardano community better audit proposals and their success. I also think that this proposal has the potential to be very impactful for the cardano community because of the many utilities it provides, such as oversight into new catalyst governance initiatives. Although there are some additional aspects of the proposal that are not directly related to the challenge setting of auditing funded proposals, such as increasing interest and engagement with cardano governance processes, the proposal overall can make an impact on auditing funded proposals. Since the proposal had a few components that don’t directly affect auditing (in my opinion), I can’t give a full score for impact. (score given: 4)

### Feasibility

Given the information provided, I believe that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposers all have many years of experience in the necessary fields to complete this project, such as finance, decision-making, accountancy, and community engagement, just to name a few. The proposers also have a dedicated subteam of two members to offer accountant and financial services to catalyst projects. The main deliverables/duties of the oversight group are surveys, workshops, internal retrospectives, final reports, and research. Each has a part in the overall goal of the proposal, and I think that they can all be achieved in the given timeframe. There is a roadmap that is thoroughly laid out starting from before fund8 going up until fund9. The information was very easy for me to read and gives me confidence that the proposers have thought out their plans and know what they are doing. The funding breakdown of the proposal was also very well done. All costs were considered, ranging from logistical costs to costs for certain tasks. It was very clear to me where the money was going, so I think that this proposal can operate smoothly and be successful. Although I do not have experience with a group doing this kind of work, I think that the funds requested are sufficient given the amount of work that will be going into this proposal. (score given: 5)

### Auditability

Given the information provided, I think that this proposal is highly auditable. The proposers plan to publish their documents and work on a gitbook page for the entire cardano community to observe. They plan to document their research, their meeting notes, workshop summaries, and a few other important trackable components that will allow for good auditability. The most important output for auditability will definitely be the Project Close Report that will provide an overview of the progress made and the lessons learned throughout the process. Additionally, the proposers listed some slightly more measures of success, such as making governance transparent. The intangible metrics are very good to include, but are slightly more subjective in their “success.” Despite this, I think that the cardano community will be able to keep up with this proposal to see if they were successful in their goals. (score given: 5)
