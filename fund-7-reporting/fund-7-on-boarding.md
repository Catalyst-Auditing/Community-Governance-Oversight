### Funding Section

In order to receive funding, a working ada address needs to be supplied and confirmed. This address will be used initially to test validity for further funding. Only after successful confirmation of the test transaction, additional funds may be sent. Funds are not distributed all at once but in batches based on the regular submission of reports on project progress. Only in very exceptional cases this can be re-considered. Proper argumentation needs to be provided for the early fund release. There will also be a requirement of proof of life where you'll need to hop on a call with the Catalyst team with a video camera to help address due diligence. More details will be provided in during the onboarding call. Thank you for your kind understanding.

### Your project's ada payment address \*

Make sure this is a correct address. Triple check it, please!
