![](../.gitbook/assets/2022-01-27.png)



This presentation is the latest of a series of community research initiatives in support of the F7 Community Governance Oversight Proposal.&#x20;

Previous events have covered Antifragile Success criteria & How to nurture a listening culture in Catalyst ? And today we will look at oversight of Catalyst parameter changes through the lens of the Cynefin Framework.

The Cynefin Framework is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making. It was created in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services. Cynefin is a Welsh word that can be translated as habitat but its meaning extends to the domains we live in and the places you come from.
