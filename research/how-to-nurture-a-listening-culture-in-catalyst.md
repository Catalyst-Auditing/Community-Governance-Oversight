### How to nurture a listening culture in Catalyst

Stephen Whitenstall, QA-DAO

I do not regard myself as an expert or even a good listener myself.

Interactions and experiences with different parts of the community and many conversations with different individuals have brought me here. &#x20;

As governance issues come to the fore the importance of different voices being heard becomes critical and I now see it as a capability we should all nurture.

### Why is Listening important ?

#### Building communities – listening as onboarding

We talk a lot about on-boarding in Catalyst, but what induces new people to stay  ?

In part it is spaces where people listen to each other, provide acknowledgement and evaluative feedback. Where they feel they have crossed a threshold and feel at home.

#### Listening gives you insight

Good listeners are aware of themselves & who they are listening to. They have situational awareness.

#### Listening motivates speaking

Voices that feel they are heard will be more likely to engage and speak up. There is a double-bind here because this also implies that the voices you hear are the ones that have been listened to. Not the voices that struggle to be heard.

#### Negative interactions have a bigger impact than positive ones.

A single negative experience of not being listened has a disproportionately big impact on a person. Research has suggested it is up to 5 times as impactful as a single positive experience. You remember what hurts you.

#### Security  - spotting deception.

Conman are good listeners. People who are not listening are easier to deceive and distract.

### Listening is not …

#### Slide Presentations – this is not listening

Presentations, particularly long ones, is not listening. Of course slide decks are needed to inform and educate. But an excess of self-promotion, self-referential and qualifying information will prompt people to stop listening.

#### Listening is not … Surveying for feedback & data analysis

There is a culture of surveying in Catalyst which typically forms the basis for how we represent ourselves. But this information is always solicited and framed according to the concerns & priorities of the surveyor. If novel voices are to be heard then unsolicited feedback must be discovered.&#x20;

#### Listening is not … Solving problems

The temptation to fix things prioritizes and foregrounds your own knowledge. Whereas actual listening is the wisdom to quieten your voice and risk hearing another voice.

#### Listening is not … An opportunity to demonstrate leadership

If you are focused on how you lead you are not really listening.

### Project Aristotle – Productive Teams

In 2012 Google commissioned a study to find out what makes a good team. After three years of collecting data they found that the most productive teams have members who

•speak in roughly the same proportion - “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.”

•have a higher “average social sensitivity,” which means they were good at intuiting one another’s feelings based on things like tone of voice, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues.

### Project Aristotle - What matters the most ?

This research identified dynamics that contributed to interdependent teamwork.

What mattered the most was :

#### Psychological safety – do you feel safe enough to take risks ?

Teams who co-operate closely and can express themselves feel safe enough to take the risk of speaking and exposing the vulnerability of their perspective.

#### Dependability – can team members rely on each other ?

Team members support each other with contributions and can be relied on to complete work.

#### Structure & clarity – understanding expectations, relevant measures

Where teams listen to each they have a clear understanding of what is expected of them. Goals can then be set at an individual and group level. And any Key Performance Indicators will be relevant and attainable.

#### Meaning – a sense of purpose

There is space for a varied sense of purpose which often depends upon personal priorities & circumstances being heard. Not a centralised or homogenous message.

#### Impact – the sense of making a difference & contributing

Impact – the sense of making a difference & contributing to the organisation as a whole. Accessible user journeys that can direct people where they feel most valued.
