### Comments in Zoom Chat

**Tevo Saks :** Why we want to get unintellectual?

**Dor Garbash :** Love if you could elaborate on what unintellectual means in this context

**Dan Verowski :** To mitigate habit due. To specialization

**Tevo Saks :** You lost me at unintellctual side, but you got me back on board with accountability mechanisms :D

**Zo√© Kleist :** Maybe unintellectual means idiot-proof?

**Carlos Leite :** Unintellectual in the sense that everyone should be able to understand the ideas and not the case were ideas are so over-intellectualed the only ‚Äúexperts‚Äù ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù what is going on

**John Wellesz \[ANFRA] :** Is an anthill considered antifragile?

**Dor Garbash :** I would call unintellectual - ‚Äú_understandable_‚Äù

**Marta L :** Unintellectual helps to avoid silos

**Dor Garbash :** Makes it less triggering

**Dan Verowski :** 100% @Marta

**Dor Garbash :** Also understandability has it‚Äôs own definition and ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù how to achieve

**Dor Garbash :**&#x20;

**Marta L :** Does removing leave a scar? How many scars before the system changes its form?

**Zo√© Kleist :** regarding the "unintellectual" discussion: I also think that there are Problems with Levels of competence. they all have their own language, so it would Need work from "translators"... I mean some Things just cannot be broken down to easily understandable language...?

**Jeremy K :** @zoe can you give some examples of things that you feel cannot be broken down to easily understandable language?

**Jeremy K :** redundancy leads to resilience and robustness but is different than anti-fragile

**Zo√© Kleist :** @jeremy, well, Maybe, everything can be broken down - but there's Always so much information that just gets lost. think about something very very complex like how a computer works or quantum mechanics. the "lower" you go, the more information you throw out - and! the more metaphors you use! but metaphors don't only highlight aspects, they also hide some. to understand in metaphors, you Need to have several metaphors. (well, our understanding works Pretty metaphorically, if you are interested in that I'd recommend reading into Lakoff & Johnsons work :)) during studying that, i continued to spot more and more both Advantages and disadvantages of metaphors that get used to let others understand something better. conclusion: if you want to make something understandable for everyone, you will have to throw out a lot of information and this is something to Keep in mind. it may get understandable, but it will be in language of the lowest Level of competence.

**Daniel Ribar** : everyfork will bring more parameters potentially üôÇ

**Zo√© Kleist :** am sorry for writing a book here :) but Stephen talked about how Switzerland‚Äôs Government works, which is a good example here: when we (I'm Swiss) vote, we get information for different Levels of competence. there are even organisations that specialise on some groups of people, like youth. and then they get something Illustrated (additionally!) while the official stuff contains both average Level understanding and also the law text that are up to Voting (which is expert Level of competence, but it is still there)

**Zo√© Kleist :** (i mean the Texts that explain what is up to vote:))

**Vanessa Cardui :** @Zoe - that's interesting, ta. In Switzerland, who decides what level of competence you are, and what info you are given? Do you decide for yourself, is it all available to anyone who wants?

**Zo√© Kleist :** if you can vote, you get the average/normal AND the law text / the very detailed one if you fit into a Special group like youth, you get that Special Explanation additionally :)

**Daniel Ribar :** and you have to practice flying or you are becoming dangerous over time if you don't

**Tyler Wales :** Maybe start with flying a drone before a passenger plane @daniel

**Marta L :** There is an interesting concept by A.N. Whitehead, on ‚Äúconcrescence‚Äù which discusses a way to move from past to future, which may be applicable. In middle of this simple video:&#x20;

**Marek Buchowiecki :** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus\_factor

**Hamza Developer :** @poetic when do you consider the challenge to be failed? Is it by the metrics?

**Poetic Science :** 16 years in the insurance industry and doing risk assessments, I have to say.....I probably would not "insure" what we are doing.

**Poetic Science :** @hamza, not specifically. test/fail.  The challenge wouldn't be a real "fail", it would be

**Poetic Science :** when testing something and it doesn't work, that's a failed hypothesis.

**Peter Wolcott :** The hypothesis failed‚Ä¶ how do you differentiate that or express that in terms of ‚Äúreturn on intent‚Äù

**Tevo Saks :** Welcome to Proposal Factory

**Poetic Science :** Return on Intent is confirmation of practice or testing. Return is 100%.

**Poetic Science :** Anyone familiar with the Star Trek movie, When Jim beats Spocks test?  But the test was designed to fail?

**Vanessa Cardui :** If we think about a project having ‚Äúfailed‚Äù, and if we agree this not necessarily a bad thing, and that we want to be able to risk failure ‚Äì then we need audit/evaluation processes that build in some kind of process of looking at what we \*learnt\* from what superficially looks like a failure (e.g. a project not achieving its stated aims).

**Vanessa Cardui :** We also need to be able to record not just bluntly ‚Äúdid we meet our stated aims or not‚Äù but also processes that can record and capture ‚Äúwell, we didn‚Äôt achieve what we expected, but we did achieve things we never expected.‚Äù

**Poetic Science :** yes Vanessa. And, as technology develops, we can retry the experiment

**Nori Nishigaya :** Are we trading efficiency for resiliency?

**Jo Allum :** Balancing?  Rather than trading‚Ä¶

**Poetic Science :** I think it's important to realize that they all rely on participants within their network

**Chris Keller :** When you crash a racecar in practice vs crashing at the finish line of a race. Two very different objectives at the time. While crashing in testing has less at risk, some moments are more fragile like last lap of a championship. We need to crash to learn and midigate risks at time.

**Matthias Sieber :** agile is in fragile \*mind blown\*

**Poetic Science :** if you have groups of heterogenous and homogeneous groups, engaged groups and exploratory groups, that all interact, similar to sociocracy, then it's an antifragile system.

**Poetic Science :** groups of skilled participants is what I meant

**Nori Nishigaya :** Some very deep areas require hyper-levels of specialization because of the decades of learning required to even master the basics, let alone adding to the field.

**Poetic Science :** distributed decision making eventually promotes a type of autocratic, or empowerment of an individual to act autonomously, yet within the norms or guides of the group

**Tevo Saks :** specialization is good thing, but I back up Oscar a little. There are new skills emerging which is combination of those. and some of us like to be jack of all trades.

**Poetic Science :**&#x20;

**Poetic Science :** there needs to be groups of domain experts

**Nori Nishigaya :** It‚Äôs nice we live in a society that is diverse enough to accommodate all styles of living and achieving so we don‚Äôt have to pick one over another.

**Poetic Science :** once we reached a shared collectiveness, a higher consciousness, we will no longer need these things. We will self-heal

**Nori Nishigaya :** I like the idea of optimizing flow or throughput. It‚Äôs the difference between Scrum that looks at optimizing predictability and story points delivered, and Kanban, which looks at optimizing flow and unblocking the pipeline.

**Jo Allum :** üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªOptimising for thrive-ability‚Ä¶ all the messy and the structured parts of the experiment‚Ä¶ what do we measure? Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs experiment: the living standards framework - https://clik.vc/lsf21

**tegegne Tefera :** @Oscar I am wondering about your understanding about the emphasis antifragility being distribution of knowledge rather than being until specialisation.&#x20;

**Vanessa Cardui :** @tegene tefera ‚Äì ‚Äúantifragility being distribution of knowledge rather than being unit specialisation.‚Äù so you mean that in antifragile system, you can know HOW to do a lot of things ‚Äì the knowledge is distributed to you and everyone else -  but you might specialise in actually doing only some of them? or am I misinterpreting?&#x20;

**Nori Nishigaya :** I think it happens naturally and we don‚Äôt need ‚Äúpolice‚Äù

**Tevo Saks :** audits = police

**Poetic Science :** Stephen = Police

**Hamza Developer :** Is social pressure a natural policing?

**Matthias Sieber :** @Nori in short, I'm not a fan of policing, but of education, training, and practice

**Nori Nishigaya :** I‚Äôd prefer feedback over training, so I can correct in real-time based on what I did well or poorly.
